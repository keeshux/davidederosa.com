        <p>While many people copy and paste unoriginal thoughts about AI and the so-called “vibe coding”, it seems that what used to make software valuable is constantly put aside. If you try to argue that tech <em>does</em> matter in a tech-oriented product, they will tell you that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business is more important than engineering</li>
  <li>Software is useless if it doesn’t make money</li>
  <li>Users only care about features</li>
  <li>Devices are powerful, performance doesn’t matter</li>
  <li>Internet is fast, a few more GBs won’t hurt</li>
</ul>

<p>And many more dumb takes. This is the typical mentality by which consultancy firms produce the most mediocre products you will ever find.</p>

<p>I don’t want to delve into this endless – and hopeless – topic. Instead, I want to tell you a little story of how easy it is to lose control of software <em>performance</em>, and how the understanding of programming fundamentals keeps us in touch with reality. This has never been more important with the fast-paced opportunities that LLMs offer today.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-afford-low-performance">Can you afford low performance?</h3>

<p>I’m far from being a low-level programmer, yet I know C and the fundamentals of how things happen below the code.</p>

<p><a href="https://passepartoutvpn.app">Passepartout</a> is a networking app mostly dealing with VPN connections. At least in the tunnel context, performance <em>does</em> matter. When it comes to OpenVPN in particular, it’s very hard to compete with a pure C codebase – the official library – when you also have to account for the overhead of the Swift runtime. Let’s not forget about the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/73148">strict memory limits</a> of Network Extension either. The time I spent on profiling to improve efficiency, resolve memory leaks, and reduce the crash rate, among other things, is pretty massive.</p>

<p>Two months ago, a user reported a regression in the OpenVPN negotiation where the handshake would never complete. I could implement a fix quickly, yet the handshake took 4x longer than with the obsolete TunnelKit. A whopping and unacceptable 20-25s vs 5s negotiation!</p>

<h3 id="the-domino-effect-of-bad-choices">The domino effect of bad choices</h3>

<p>I inspected the negotiation steps carefully for bottlenecks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Loops</li>
  <li>Blocking code</li>
  <li>Slow I/O</li>
  <li>Disputed locks</li>
  <li>Wrong artificial delays</li>
  <li>Parsing</li>
  <li>…and whatnot!</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if your life as a programmer only revolved around high-level languages like JavaScript, Python, or even Swift, you will have a hard time realizing the <em>time cost</em> – not the <em>O(n)</em> cost – of your code. Similar to how knowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> helps immensely when profiling a slow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORM</a>, knowing C helps you spot poor performance in high-level programs, even if you never get to write C code.</p>

<p>It took me 1-2 days to realize that the culprit was ironically where I expected it the least. The performance hit was caused by <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/pull/1095">the parser of the PUSH_REPLY</a> message, which is a short comma-separated string. To be fair, the parser is quite basic, so it wasn’t the parser either: the problem was about <strong>re-creating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSRegularExpression</code> objects every time a new PUSH_REPLY was parsed</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn’t take a lot to create an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSRegularExpression</code> but the user’s server sent dozens of PUSH_REPLY messages to the client, so the slow code was adding up very quickly. Run a 100ms vs 500ms code once and it will be okay, but run it 20 times and you easily get a 2 seconds vs 10 seconds delay. In the vast majority of servers, the PUSH_REPLY is a single message, which made the nasty issue unnoticeable to most.</p>

<p>By then, I realized how too much OOP makes us programmers forget that even creating objects may be expensive. Imagine what AI can do without a supervisor. When performance is crucial, we should remind ourselves that the convenient, good-looking solution might be the <em>worse</em> choice.</p>

<h3 id="what-vibe-coders-may-not-be-ready-for">What “vibe coders” may not be ready for</h3>

<p>Before anything, ask yourself what <em>your business</em> is about. If you work at Netflix, or in the game industry, you might observe the immediate effect of an inefficient vibe-coded algorithm. In the trivial CRUD apps that make up 99.9% of the consultancy workforce, instead, you may only realize that your code has low performance after a long chain of bad choices, if ever.</p>

<p>Performance, however, is just an example of what’s being overseen due to the increasingly fast pace at which people produce code.</p>

<p>This leads to a few observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your software is “stupid”, low performance may only be hidden and therefore not seem a big deal.</li>
  <li>Engineers who underestimate the importance of performant solutions, probably never worked on challenging projects.</li>
  <li>If performance doesn’t matter to <em>you</em> today, it doesn’t mean it’s not important in general. Or, that it won’t be important when <em>your</em> business scales up.</li>
</ul>

<p>When that day comes, will you have the knowledge you need to face it?</p>
