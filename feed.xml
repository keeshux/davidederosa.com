<h2 id="version-2-was-a-mess">Version 2 was a mess</h2>

<p>Passepartout used to be two separate iOS and macOS apps, with all the complications that this implies. In 2022, I used Passepartout to learn <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> –I considered Flutter initially– and make v2 a partially multiplatform app. Partially because the macOS app was a hybrid <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Catalyst/iPad</a> app, a terrible choice if I think of it today. I don’t even know why I did it, but whatever.</p>

<p>The conclusions I drew after v2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SwiftUI is very hard to get right. I had to rewrite my views multiple times due to my wrong understanding of the framework.</li>
  <li>Catalyst made the macOS app an ugly and unstable iPadOS app, let alone a complete nightmare to develop.</li>
  <li>The time I spent on the Mac system menu, in particular, was beyond ridiculous. Maybe I’ll dedicate a post to this clunky Catalyst/AppKit interaction.</li>
  <li>The app core was overengineered, untested, untestable, and confusing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit">TunnelKit</a> was already unmanageable and inextensible. Touching the wrong line could break connectivity for thousands of users.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m aware that we, developers, occasionally suffer an innate tendency to be unsatisfied with our choices, whatever they are. Redoing the same things over and over is detrimental to making progress, though. Therefore, rewriting software should <em>never</em> be your first choice. That’s why I ruminated around the idea for months, but the rewrite was inevitable 7 years after the first release.</p>

<p>Users don’t and can’t realize the amount of bugs that Passepartout v2 and TunnelKit had. The codebase, <em>my codebase</em>, was such a high barrier that it took me a year (2022 to 2023) to resolve some legitimate concerns with iCloud. Requests/bugs were sadly flowing at 30x the speed I was able to address them. The app was half abandoned.</p>

<p>It’s, however, very risky to rewrite an app that was stable, making decent money, and required very little support despite a user base in the hundreds of thousands. To end up, one year later, with the same app with more or less the same features.</p>

<p>Rewriting must be <em>really</em> worth it.</p>

<h2 id="the-costbenefit-of-rewriting-software">The cost/benefit of rewriting software</h2>

<p>Version 3 is the last time I <em>intend</em> to attack the foundations of Passepartout.</p>

<p>So many times I rewrote code in my life with the sole intent of working in a “beautiful” codebase, not realizing how quickly the enthusiasm wanes when the development routine is back to normal. Give it a few months and, no matter what, your codebase will look “ugly” again. It never ends.</p>

<p>I learned not to rely on “beauty” to bring me back to the joy of programming. After all, when I wrote those nasty lines 10 years ago, I probably thought it was the state of the art. Right?</p>

<p>Today, I try to refactor software as a regular exercise, but at a smaller scale, and with a different purpose:</p>

<p><strong>Make my changes last as long as possible.</strong></p>

<p>Below is what I did in 2024 –part-time until August– for this major update:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/passepartoutvpn/projects/1/views/4?filterQuery=">The GitHub Project for v3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/passepartoutvpn/projects/1/views/8?filterQuery=">The tasks split by goal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The project encompassed ~1000 items, of which ~350 are invisible for being in private repositories. An insane amount of work, in hindsight.</p>

<p>Today, I can confirm that it was by no means a waste of time. After one year of development, the success of this reengineering is summarized in a sentence:</p>

<p><strong>Most areas of Passepartout won’t need to be modified for years to come.</strong></p>

<p>This is the single measure you want to focus on when considering a big architectural redesign: the time you save in the long run must dramatically compensate for the effort of rewriting. With this mantra, good design will be the natural consequence. Because good design, ultimately, is meant to save development time.</p>

<p>The best code of your software is the one you forget about, the one you don’t need to touch ever again.</p>]]></content><author><name>Davide De Rosa</name></author><category term="development" /><category term="refactoring" /><category term="planning" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For software to live a long life, it must grow together with our experience.

For iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.</p>

<p>I dare to say, automated releases are hardly (if <em>ever</em>) seen in open-source *OS apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.fastlane.tools/">fastlane</a>, created by <a href="https://krausefx.com/">Felix Krause</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> helped me immensely with the fast turnaround of Passepartout releases. In the era of LLMs, you have no excuses to waste time for not using these incredible tools.</p>

<p>Let me show why CI/CD is one of the most important and underestimated aspects of making indie software, or software in general.</p>

<h3 id="its-just-an-app-right">It’s just an app, right?</h3>

<p>Many people are confident that <em>The Idea</em> is the most valuable aspect of a product.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you developed an app for the App Store, at any level of complexity, you know how exhausting the whole process is. There is so much more than “writing the code”, which is nothing trivial to start with.</p>

<h3 id="the-app-store-requirements-will-beat-you">The App Store requirements will beat you</h3>

<p>Choosing the icons. Crafting the screenshots. Writing the metadata. Picking the categories. Localizations. The business model. In-app purchases. Sorting out the legal aspects. The App Review process. And so on.</p>

<p>Wait, have I mentioned the codesigning process? Development, Ad-Hoc, Distribution. Multiple platforms. Debug and Release.</p>

<p>Especially at the beginning, it’s overwhelming and discouraging. We’ve all been there.</p>

<p>The 15-30% cut that Apple takes from your revenue is almost a marginal cost compared to all this.</p>

<h3 id="the-fear-of-change">The fear of change</h3>

<p>Here’s a very subtle side-effect of the above: once your tedious setup finally works, you might <em>refrain from changing</em>.</p>

<p>Some relatable examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I change the UI, I will have to change the screenshots for X languages and Y platforms.</li>
  <li>If I alter some inner logic, I will get a rejection from Apple.</li>
  <li>If I introduce a regression, I will get bad reviews.</li>
  <li>Even if I have a hotfix in time, Apple will push my release back for silly reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>It goes without saying, this is an atrocious outcome for your product. If you work alone with no one to delegate these annoyances to, you risk falling into the ultimate recipe for failure.</p>

<p><em>Stagnation is the hidden cost of expensive deployment.</em></p>

<h3 id="you-must-learn-to-automate">You MUST learn to automate</h3>

<p>The key to keeping focus on the product is <em>automation</em>. It’s boring at first, but in the long run, it’s your best bet against the inevitable frustration of using App Store Connect.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you find yourself doing 3+ times the same task, automate it.</li>
  <li>If a task doesn’t need constant interaction, automate it.</li>
  <li>If a task is sensitive to human mistakes, automate it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Observe your routine and you will soon realize how many hours you are wasting on dumb tasks, time you could have spent on useful features for your customers.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-integration-is-underused">Continuous integration is underused!</h3>

<p>After 15 years working with Apple devices, I can still confirm this trend: the vast majority of iOS developers don’t know jack about <em>continuous integration</em>. Which is crazy because fastlane has been around since 2014. GitHub Actions has a shorter history, but there have always been alternatives: Travis-CI, GitLab, Circle-CI, and whatnot.</p>

<p>In the next posts, I’ll show you how I used fastlane and GitHub Actions to automate the release of Passepartout for iOS, macOS, and tvOS at once.</p>

<p>However, a couple of regressions were still haunting me.</p>

<p>Here I want to describe the absurd journey into one of them, that started with a report <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/issues/1204">from GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/passepartout/comments/1j0lbqa/not_open_in_sonoma_any_idea/">one from Reddit</a>. Both users were reporting that the Mac app was crashing on launch.</p>

<p>The reports led me to think that the regression was caused by the macOS version, or the CPU architecture, as both users were using an Intel-based machine.</p>

<h3 id="the-xcode-organizer">The Xcode Organizer</h3>

<p>I had several (unhelpful) crashes in the Xcode Organizer confirming the issue:</p>

<div class="h-scrolling">
    <img alt="Xcode Organizer" src="/s/posts/2025-03-03-01.png" />
</div>

<p>Looking further into some crashes, I could spot a few SIGILL (Illegal Hardware Instruction) that reinforced the idea of a platform-related issue. Add to that, one of the threads had intense Core Data + CloudKit activity ongoing. It must be Core Data, I thought, given that Passepartout performs its sync precisely when the app launches.</p>

<p><em>Doubt #1: how can the app launch at all if the arch is unsupported?</em></p>

<p><em>Doubt #2: is the Core Data stack trace relevant? Is it the thread that is actually crashing?</em></p>

<h3 id="never-read-crash-reports-only-once">Never read crash reports only once</h3>

<p>Passepartout is a privacy-oriented app. There is no external framework e.g. Firebase to help with crash resolution, so Xcode is the only technical resource at disposal. Plus the patient support from the affected users.</p>

<p>Eventually, Core Data was a distraction. Every report was crashing on “Thread 0”, i.e. the main thread. There were also crashes from macOS 15 and ARM64. Fewer, but non-zero.</p>

<p>This stack trace shed some light in that the injected AppDelegate could be the culprit. But where? And why?</p>

<h3 id="reproducing-the-crash-pt-1">Reproducing the crash (pt. 1)</h3>

<p>Assuming that the AppDelegate was doing something wrong, there was even a much bigger issue: I could not reproduce the crash on my machine. I realized, though, that a friend of mine had an Intel MacBook with macOS 14, so I asked for his help.</p>

<p>He gave me access via AnyDesk to push ad hoc builds to the machine. The latest app version crashed consistently. Off to a good start. At that point, I spent a few hours trying to exclude potentially offending parts from the launch code, sadly to no avail. Consider that any change in the code implied archiving and sending a build via AnyDesk to test it. It was exhausting, and the afternoon led nowhere.</p>

<h3 id="reproducing-the-crash-pt-2">Reproducing the crash (pt. 2)</h3>

<p>I decide to give a shot to virtualization. Most crashes came from macOS 14, and not necessarily from Intel machines, so this could work. These were the steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> to run a VM on Mac. <em>Highly recommended!</em></li>
  <li>Download a restore image for Sonoma (~14GB)</li>
  <li>Regenerate the provisioning profile with the VM UDID</li>
  <li>Send the development build via a shared folder to the VM</li>
</ul>

<p>The app crashes. Hooray!</p>

<h3 id="git-to-the-rescue">Git to the rescue</h3>

<p>Time to locate where the regression was introduced. I rebuilt the app for each commit that sounded relevant, and after 10-20 builds, I found out that the crash was introduced in <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/pull/1200">this pull request</a> about the light/dark mode picker in the app preferences. WTF?!</p>

<p>It turns out, the widely used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapp"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> singleton</a> is an <strong>implicitly unwrapped optional</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@MainActor
var NSApp: NSApplication!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it was therefore used unsafely in this bit of the PR:</p>

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpassepartoutvpn%2Fpassepartout%2Fblob%2Fv3.1.1%2FPackages%2FApp%2FSources%2FUILibrary%2FBusiness%2FAppearanceManager.swift%23L66-73&amp;style=default&amp;type=code&amp;showBorder=on&amp;showLineNumbers=on&amp;showFileMeta=on&amp;showFullPath=on&amp;showCopy=on"></script>

<h3 id="a-race-condition-about-nsapp">A race condition about NSApp</h3>

<p>It’s finally revealed that, very early in a Mac app lifecycle, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> may be nil. This was more often the case on macOS 14 than 15, but still a hideous race condition.</p>

<p>Here goes the simplified stack call:</p>

<ul>
  <li>main</li>
  <li>AppDelegate.init</li>
  <li>AppearanceManager.init</li>
  <li>AppearanceManager.systemAppearance.didSet</li>
  <li>AppearanceManager.apply()</li>
  <li>NSApp.appearance = …</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last call, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> may be nil and implicitly unwrapped, leading to the crash.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h3>

<p>This was one of those bugs that make you question everything—platform differences, architecture quirks, even Core Data conspiracies—before revealing a simple yet insidious root cause: a race condition with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code>.</p>

<p>The takeaway? Even well-documented singletons aren’t always safe to assume as non-nil. And when debugging obscure crashes, patience and a systematic approach (plus a good VM setup) can make all the difference.</p>

<p>Passepartout v3.1.5 <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/pull/1224">will handle this case properly</a>, ensuring that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> is accessed only when it’s actually available. Hopefully, that’s one less obscure crash lurking in the shadows.</p>

<p>To Apple and Swift: isn’t it about time to discourage/deprecate the use of implicitly unwrapped optionals?</p>]]></content><author><name>Davide De Rosa</name></author><category term="development" /><category term="swift" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One month after its first, painful release, Passepartout v3 is close to being stable.

Never read crash reports only once Passepartout is a privacy-oriented app. There is no external framework e.g. Firebase to help with crash resolution, so Xcode is the only technical resource at disposal. Plus the patient support from the affected users. Eventually, Core Data was a distraction. Every report was crashing on “Thread 0”, i.e. the main thread. There were also crashes from macOS 15 and ARM64. Fewer, but non-zero. This stack trace shed some light in that the injected AppDelegate could be the culprit. But where? And why?

Reproducing the crash (pt. 1) Assuming that the AppDelegate was doing something wrong, there was even a much bigger issue: I could not reproduce the crash on my machine. I realized, though, that a friend of mine had an Intel MacBook with macOS 14, so I asked for his help. He gave me access via AnyDesk to push ad hoc builds to the machine. The latest app version crashed consistently. Off to a good start. At that point, I spent a few hours trying to exclude potentially offending parts from the launch code, sadly to no avail. Consider that any change in the code implied archiving and sending a build via AnyDesk to test it. It was exhausting, and the afternoon led nowhere. Reproducing the crash (pt. 2) I decide to give a shot to virtualization. Most crashes came from macOS 14, and not necessarily from Intel machines, so this could work. These were the steps: Get UTM to run a VM on Mac. Highly recommended! Download a restore image for Sonoma (~14GB) Regenerate the provisioning profile with the VM UDID Send the development build via a shared folder to the VM The app crashes. Hooray! Git to the rescue Time to locate where the regression was introduced. I rebuilt the app for each commit that sounded relevant, and after 10-20 builds, I found out that the crash was introduced in this pull request about the light/dark mode picker in the app preferences. WTF?! It turns out, the widely used NSApp singleton is an implicitly unwrapped optional: @MainActor var NSApp: NSApplication! and it was therefore used unsafely in this bit of the PR: A race condition about NSApp It’s finally revealed that, very early in a Mac app lifecycle, NSApp may be nil. This was more often the case on macOS 14 than 15, but still a hideous race condition. Here goes the simplified stack call: main AppDelegate.init AppearanceManager.init AppearanceManager.systemAppearance.didSet AppearanceManager.apply() NSApp.appearance = … In the last call, NSApp may be nil and implicitly unwrapped, leading to the crash. Lessons learned This was one of those bugs that make you question everything—platform differences, architecture quirks, even Core Data conspiracies—before revealing a simple yet insidious root cause: a race condition with NSApp. The takeaway? Even well-documented singletons aren’t always safe to assume as non-nil. And when debugging obscure crashes, patience and a systematic approach (plus a good VM setup) can make all the difference. Passepartout v3.1.5 will handle this case properly, ensuring that NSApp is accessed only when it’s actually available. Hopefully, that’s one less obscure crash lurking in the shadows. To Apple and Swift: isn’t it about time to discourage/deprecate the use of implicitly unwrapped optionals?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wallet software</title><link href="https://davidederosa.com/basic-blockchain-programming/wallet-software/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wallet software" /><published>2015-06-23T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2015-06-23T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://davidederosa.com/basic-blockchain-programming/wallet-software</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://davidederosa.com/basic-blockchain-programming/wallet-software/"><![CDATA[<p>Commonly, Bitcoin users rely on clients called <em>wallets</em> to create transactions and interact with the p2p network. Even Bitcoin Core is a wallet itself, besides being the official software for mining. Other well-known wallets are <a href="https://electrum.org">Electrum</a>, <a href="https://hivewallet.com">Hive</a> etc. Here I’ll try to describe the components of a wallet.</p>

<h3 id="data-model">Data model</h3>

<p>These are the typical data structures that a wallet maintains internally. Most of them accomplish the core business of the wallet, that is building transactions and broadcasting them to the Bitcoin network. Things like <em>change addresses</em> or encryption are convenient features yet not mandatory for a fully working implementation.</p>

<h4 id="keypairs">Keypairs</h4>

<p>In the last paragraphs about the <a href="/basic-blockchain-programming/network-interoperability-part-two/">Bitcoin network</a>, you learned how to create a primitive wallet. Given an ECDSA keypair, a basic Bitcoin wallet is made of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The WIF-encoded private key.</li>
  <li>The Base58Check-encoded hash160 of the public key, i.e. the P2PKH address.</li>
</ul>

<p>Real wallets actually create many keypairs, but stick with a single one for the sake of simplicity. In a tiered context, the keypair is the foundation of our data model and will “hold” our coins.</p>

<h4 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h4>

<p>The blockchain component determines if a wallet is <em>thin</em> or <em>heavyweight</em>. Heavyweight wallets like Bitcoin Core are backed by a full blockchain, whereas thin wallets like Electrum and Hive only need a part of it or none at all, thus being suitable for slow connections or devices with limited capabilities like smartphones.</p>

<p>“Heavy” really means it. At the time of writing, a Bitcoin Core wallet would take about 40GB of disk space to allocate the full blockchain locally, which includes all broadcast Bitcoin transactions since the beginning of time. And increasing. Conveniently, a thin client is much faster under the assumption that a normal user is not interested in every transaction in Bitcoin history. Instead, it will only download <em>relevant</em> transactions, that is transactions in which the user appears as a sender or a receiver.</p>

<p>Focus on keypairs again. If our wallet only deals with standard P2PKH transactions –and most do–, we can safely assume that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user is a receiver when his address appears in a transaction output script.</li>
  <li>The user is a sender when his public key appears in a transaction input script.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s see why. Consider the typical P2PKH output script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_DUP
OP_HASH160
[hash160(public_key)]
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>the typical P2PKH input script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[signature]
[public_key]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the relevancy scan in pseudocode:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>outpoint = struct { txid, index };

relevant_txs = {};  /* txid -&gt; tx */
utxos = {};         /* outpoint */
balance = 0;

for (tx in blockchain.txs) {

    /* 1 */
    for (txout in tx.outputs) {
        if (!is_p2pkh_output(txout.script)) {
            continue;
        }
        if (txout.script contains hash160(keypair.public_key)) {
            relevant_txs.add(tx);

            outpoint = outpoint(tx.id, txout.index);
            utxos.add(outpoint);
            balance += txout.value;
        }
    }

    /* 2 */
    for (txin in tx.inputs) {
        if (!is_p2pkh_input(txin.script)) {
            continue;
        }
        if (txin.script contains keypair.public_key) {
            relevant_txs.add(tx);

            outpoint = txin.outpoint;
            previous_tx = relevant_txs[outpoint.txid];
            prev_txout = previous_tx.outputs[outpoint.index];
            utxos.remove(outpoint);
            balance -= prev_txout.value;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(1) If any P2PKH transaction output contains the hash160 of our public key –our Bitcoin address–, the transaction is relevant to our wallet. Such an output associates more coins to our wallet keypair and contributes to the <em>output value</em> of the wallet. Until it’s spent, the output is an element of the UTXO set of the wallet, therefore increasing the balance.</p>

<p>(2) If any P2PKH transaction input contains our public key, the transaction is relevant to our wallet. Such a transaction input spends coins associated with our wallet keypair, specifically it spends the output referenced by the input outpoint. The previous output is removed from the UTXO set because outputs are always spent in their entirety. After the spend, the balance decreases.</p>

<p>Incidentally, you may notice that the relevant transactions form the <em>history</em> of a wallet.</p>

<h4 id="utxos">UTXOs</h4>

<p>So, given a keypair, the two criteria dramatically cut down the search time for relevant transactions in the blockchain, be it local (heavyweight wallet) or remote (thin wallet). To build new transactions, though, we must track the UTXO set, which appears to be a bonus result of the scanning process. All transaction outputs are initially added to the UTXOs, but they’re later removed if reused in another transaction as input outpoints. The final set provides us with the available outpoints for building new transactions.</p>

<p>We can also compute the wallet balance from the UTXOs:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>balance = 0;

for (outpoint in utxos) {
    unspent_tx = relevant_txs[outpoint.txid];
    unspent_txout = unspent_tx.outputs[outpoint.index];
    balance += unspent_txout.value;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="modularization">Modularization</h3>

<p>From an architectural perspective, a wallet software can be split into 3 independent modules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Signing module.</li>
  <li>Public addresses module.</li>
  <li>Networking module.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most wallets are essentially monolithic, others are hybrid in that they sign transactions in a separate module. <a href="https://www.bitcointrezor.com/">TREZOR</a> is a well-known example of hybrid wallet where the signing module is even pushed to an external device.</p>

<h4 id="signing">Signing</h4>

<p>This module is the only one holding sensitive data: the private key(s). It receives an unsigned transaction and returns a signed one, ready to be published to the Bitcoin network. Since the signing task involves just ECDSA, the module can be -and often is- conveniently implemented in hardware. This arrangement allows for strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">2-factor authentication</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.firebrick.co.uk/images/otp.jpg" alt="One-Time Password device" /></p>

<p>Think of OTP (One-Time Password) devices, those handy password generators designed to fit in your keyring. OTPs are often used for private banking to generate a login token that is only valid within a short time period. The token is the second step you take to enter your bank account after entering your credentials, and additional tokens can be requested for particularly sensitive operations. Your brain (the credentials) and the OTP device (the token) together protect the account. You won’t be able to log in in case you miss any of the two.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bitcointrezor.com/images/carousel_4.png" alt="TREZOR signing device" /></p>

<p>Now look at the TREZOR. The TREZOR signing device is also part of a 2-factor authentication scheme, because the ability to create a transaction depends on 2 physically separate modules: the TREZOR itself (for the ECDSA keys) and a networking/blockchain software running on desktop or mobile (for the UTXOs). The device receives an unsigned transaction and signs it after manual confirmation. Then, the signed transaction is sent back to the network-connected software and finally broadcast. Again, the device alone won’t be able to build transactions because it has zero knowledge of the blockchain. Likewise, a transaction cannot be signed by the networked software as it has no access to the private keys.</p>

<h4 id="public-addresses">Public addresses</h4>

<p>Private and public keys are strongly related, still they can live in completely different contexts. In fact, they’re loosely coupled by nature. That’s why a wallet may opt for a public addresses distribution module. However, in our single keypair scenario such a module would be overkill, because we would be distributing just one public address.</p>

<p>Public-key distribution would only make sense after learning about <a href="https://codinginmysleep.com/hd-wallets-in-plain-english/">deterministic wallets</a>, which I won’t deal with in this series. Plus, most wallets have this module conveniently merged into the networking component, since public addresses need to be constantly monitored for incoming transactions.</p>

<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>

<p>The networking module would sit in the middle of the other two, and it’s also the controller module. It’s in charge of several, sometimes complicated tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connecting to the Bitcoin p2p network.</li>
  <li>Synchronizing and keeping up with the blockchain.</li>
  <li>Monitoring relevant transactions.</li>
  <li>Publishing transactions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Especially task 1 and 2 can be a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pita">PITA</a>, look at the vague protocol description for <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain_download">blockchain download</a>. It’s no surprise that many wallet manifacturers -like <a href="https://electrum.org">Electrum</a> and <a href="https://mycelium.com">Mycelium</a>- have chosen to set up their own centralized synchronization network. Thin wallets are severely affected by the overwhelming complexity of blockchain synchronization.</p>

<p>Task 3 is described in the above paragraph about the blockchain model, and requires the knowledge of the public key of our keypair. With the public key we’re able to monitor/restore both incoming and outcoming P2PKH transactions. Most importantly, the relevant transactions history determines the UTXO set of the wallet, which we’ll need to build new transactions.</p>

<p>Task 4 is definitely the easiest, unless a wallet is advanced enough to pick the best UTXOs according to <a href="https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1077/what-is-the-coin-selection-algorithm">coin selection heuristics</a>. After gathering the UTXOs and composing the unsigned transaction, it’s transmitted to the signing module. The unsigned transaction is signed and returned to the networking module, which in turn announces it to the Bitcoin network. Finally, it waits for the transaction to be mined in the upcoming blocks of the blockchain.</p>

<h3 id="goodbye">Goodbye!</h3>

<p>That’s all. From now on, you should be <em>way</em> more comfortable with how Bitcoin works under the hood. Of course there’s much more to uncover, so I’m particularly interested in what topics you’d love to know more about. That’s why your feedback is golden, let me know in the comments what you enjoyed or didn’t about this series.</p>

<p>This is free work and I won’t explicitly beg for donations. I’d rather be glad if you take your time to spread the word and share these articles with your friends or on social networks. After all, Bitcoin is far from being mainstream and significantly counts on word of mouth.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-build-a-p2pkh-transaction">How to build a P2PKH transaction</h3>

<p>In order to build a transaction, an ECDSA keypair alone is not enough. We need the blockchain history of the keypair at our disposal, or better said, the transactions sending value to the address associated with our keypair. Then, we’ll use the ECDSA private key to produce signatures for such transaction outputs, so that they become inputs to our transaction.</p>

<p>Given:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ECDSA keypair <em>K</em>.</li>
  <li>A third-party P2PKH output address <em>A</em>.</li>
  <li>The amount <em>S</em> to transfer in satoshis.</li>
</ul>

<p>we want to send <em>S</em> satoshis to address <em>A</em> via our keypair <em>K</em>. Here’s the overall procedure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scan the blockchain for the relevant UTXOs to <em>K</em>.</li>
  <li>Build a transaction output from <em>S</em> and <em>A</em>.</li>
  <li>Gather enough input value from the UTXOs to reach <em>S</em>.</li>
  <li>For each input, generate the subject of its signature.</li>
  <li>Generate ECDSA signatures for each input subject.</li>
  <li>Pack the transaction.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s start from <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/ex-tx-build.c">ex-tx-build.c</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-utxo-set">The UTXO set</h4>

<p>At the very beginning of an ECDSA keypair history, the derived P2PKH address has no transaction outputs associated with it and therefore has no bitcoin value for the blockchain. When someone later publishes a transaction that sends bitcoins to our address, the keypair suddenly becomes a valuable asset. Consider our now famous Testnet address:</p>

<p>and its <a href="https://www.biteasy.com/testnet/addresses/mqMi3XYqsPvBWtrJTk8euPWDVmFTZ5jHuK">blockchain history</a>. Among all transactions, <a href="https://api.biteasy.com/testnet/v1/addresses/mqMi3XYqsPvBWtrJTk8euPWDVmFTZ5jHuK/unspent-outputs">three outputs</a> are still unspent at the time of writing:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/f34e1c37e736727770fed85d1b129713ef7f300304498c31c833985f487fa2f3"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f34e1c37e736...a2f3</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/65216856608dba6b74e1ea202eb712f64d340bc8cf48b8db5624447b15bd20c6"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">65216856608d...20c6</code></a></li>

</ol>

<p>totalling a 0.951 BTC output value (= 95100000 satoshis). Specifically, these are the outputs sending money to our address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first output of tx 1 (0.87 BTC).</li>
  <li>The first output of tx 2 (0.001 BTC).</li>
  <li>The second output of tx 3 (0.08 BTC).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you now translate the words into data structures:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;f34e1c37e736...a2f3, 0&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;65216856608d...20c6, 0&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;6b580bada66e...3934, 1&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>you have the UTXO outpoints for our keypair/wallet. Besides making up the balance of the wallet, the importance of the UTXO set lies in that it contains the outpoints we can reuse to build our own transactions. After spending an UTXO in a transaction input, it’s removed from the set because an UTXO is always spent in its entirety.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, scanning UTXOs would require a lot of networking code, so building a wallet history from web explorers is a quick alternative. This will cost you some privacy though, as you generally don’t want to share your addresses with untrusted services.</p>

<h4 id="the-destination-output">The destination output</h4>

<p>You should know by now how to build a P2PKH transaction output. Say we want to send 0.251 BTC (25100000 satoshis, little-endian):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e0 fe 7e 01 00 00 00 00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to this address:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mhmhRnN58ki9zbRJ63mpNGQXoYvdMXZsXt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>that decodes to the following hash160 digest:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>18 ba 14 b3 68 22 95 cb
05 23 0e 31 fe cb 00 08
92 40 66 08
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s the first output of our transaction:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/* value (0.251 BTC) */
e0 fe 7e 01 00 00 00 00

/* script length */
19

/* P2PKH script */
76 a9 14 18 ba 14 b3 68
22 95 cb 05 23 0e 31 fe
cb 00 08 92 40 66 08 88
ac
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I wrote a convenient C macro in <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/tx.h">tx.h</a> for building P2PKH outputs from a value and a hash160:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">bbp_txout_create_p2pkh</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bbp_txout_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">txout</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">uint64_t</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">hash160</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Basically, the hash160 bytes are enclosed in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_DUP OP_HASH160</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG</code> opcodes. Hexes are interpreted from left to right and are therefore encoded little-endian. We use the macro to easily create our first output:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">bbp_txout_create_p2pkh</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">outs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="mi">25100000</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s">"18ba14b3682295cb05230e31fecb000892406608"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="gathering-the-inputs">Gathering the inputs</h4>

<p>Our UTXO set is worth &lt;0.87, 0.001, 0.08&gt; BTC respectively, so the first one:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;f34e1c37e736...a2f3, 0&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>is just enough for a 0.251 BTC output. In fact our input value exceeds the output value by 0.619 BTC, which are silently returned to the transaction miner as a fee. We know an UTXO cannot be spent partially, and since the fee is somewhat relevant to us, we add a second output for <em>change</em>.</p>

<p>Our final transaction will have one input and two outputs, the second being a change output that returns the exceeding input value to our own address. Here’s the second output of our transaction:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/* value (0.619 BTC) */
e0 84 b0 03 00 00 00 00

/* script length */
19

/* P2PKH script */
76 a9 14 6b f1 9e 55 f9
4d 98 6b 46 40 c1 54 d8
64 69 93 41 91 95 11 88
ac
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the other hand, it’s quite obvious that output value cannot possibly exceed input value. Non-coinbase transactions never create bitcoin value. This is our second output in code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">bbp_txout_create_p2pkh</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">outs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="mi">61900000</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s">"6bf19e55f94d986b4640c154d864699341919511"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="building-the-signature-subject">Building the signature subject</h4>

<p>This is tricky if not even controversial, because the subject of transaction signatures is not the transaction itself. When studying ECDSA signatures, you learned that the signing process takes three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate an ECDSA keypair.</li>
  <li>Create a message.</li>
  <li>Sign the message with the private key to produce a signature.</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem here is that a Bitcoin transaction cannot be signed the usual way, since signatures are actually part of the transaction, namely the input scripts. The approach has to be different. In fact, we’ll produce a different signature for each transaction input, which in turn will embed it in its P2PKH script.</p>

<p>In practice, for each input <em>I</em>, the message to be signed is a slightly modified version of the transaction where:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <em>I</em> script is set to the output script of the UTXO it refers to.</li>
  <li>Input scripts other than <em>I</em> are truncated to zero-length.</li>
  <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGHASH</code> flag is appended.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a single input transaction we won’t need to truncate any other input script:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">bbp_outpoint_fill</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">outpoint</span><span class="p">,</span>

<p>We have the outputs and the signable inputs, so we go ahead and construct the message:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">tx</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">version</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">bbp_eint32</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">BBP_LITTLE</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>The external functions all come from <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/tx.h">tx.h</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the previous post, you know that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bbp_tx_size</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bbp_tx_serialize</code> functions take care of sizing and serializing a transaction structure to raw bytes.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bbp_outpoint_fill</code> function fills a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bbp_outpoint_t</code> structure from an UTXO. The UTXO reference consist of a previous transaction txid and the output index within the transaction.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bbp_txin_create_signable</code> function creates a fake input for our message by copying the corresponding UTXO script.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we’ll sign all transaction inputs, we set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flag</code> parameter to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGHASH_ALL</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01</code>). Beware that it’s here padded to 32-bit for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>You learned that the first step in transaction building is obtaining the UTXO set of a keypair. Outputs define the value we need to gather. Transaction output value must not exceed gathered UTXO value. Change outputs solve the indivisibility problem of UTXOs. UTXO scripts appear in the signable message of their corresponding inputs.</p>

<p>As a result of <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/ex-tx-build.c">ex-tx-build.c</a>, we built the signable message for our input. In <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/ex-tx-sign.c">ex-tx-sign.c</a> we’ll reuse the message as a starting point.</p>

<h4 id="producing-the-signature">Producing the signature</h4>

<p>Rather than the message itself, we’ll sign its hash256 digest:</p>

<p>Yes, the signing process is possibly the most annoying and error-prone part of our work.</p>

<h3 id="packing-the-transaction">Packing the transaction</h3>

<p>We’re all set to pack the transaction from our inputs and outputs. Let’s look at <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/ex-tx-pack.c">ex-tx-pack.c</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inputs-and-outputs">Inputs and outputs</h4>

<p>Like I did for outputs, I also wrote a C macro in <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/tx.h">tx.h</a> for creating P2PKH inputs. The macro takes an UTXO outpoint, a signature, a public key and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGHASH</code> flag:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">bbp_txin_create_p2pkh</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bbp_txin_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">txin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">bbp_outpoint_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">outpoint</span><span class="p">,</span>

<p>We use the macro to create our input, whereas the outputs code is taken from <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/ex-tx-build.c">ex-tx-build.c</a> as is:</p>

<h4 id="publishing-to-the-network">Publishing to the network</h4>

<p>We made it, we’ve just built our first Bitcoin transaction! What’s next? Of course we want to commit our transaction to the blockchain. To do that, web services exist to save us the burden of communicating with the p2p network.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://tbtc.blockr.io/tx/push">Blockr push service</a> (Testnet in our scenario) comes handy to publish raw transactions to the blockchain. Insert a raw transaction like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rawtx</code> output from <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/ex-tx-pack.c">ex-tx-pack.c</a> and you’re done, you can even double-check it before confirming. If you didn’t double-spend any of your UTXOs before and you’ve done everything correctly, you should see the transaction live after a few minutes. That is, as soon as it’s mined in a block.</p>

<p>However, if you try to publish our sample transaction, you’ll get the following error:</p>

<p><img src="/s/f/basic-blockchain-programming/tx-push-error.png" alt="Transaction push error" /></p>

<p>Don’t worry, that’s because I already published it by myself. See how it looks like <a href="https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/9996e2f64b6af0232dd9c897395ce51fdd35e6359edd2855c60ff823d8d657d1">on a block explorer</a>.</p>

All the loose ends about scripts will be tied up, plus you’ll practice some C code to accomplish our main mission, that is writing a raw transaction by hand.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Unfortunately, transactions and scripts are sort of a chicken and egg situation. Whatever subject you start from, you’ll definitely need a basic grasp of the other one to get things going. I chose to leave transactions last because I liked a bottom-up approach to this series, but I had to take some concepts for granted –like inputs and outputs– that are going to be clear in this final part.</p>

<h3 id="transaction-data-structures">Transaction data structures</h3>

<p>This is what a transaction embeds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some constant values.</li>
  <li>An array of one or more inputs.</li>
  <li>An array of one or more outputs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before writing raw transactions, I’m going to describe the data structures defined in <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/tx.h">tx.h</a>. Needless to say, all number fields will be serialized little-endian.</p>

<h4 id="output">Output</h4>

<p>Transaction outputs are the blockchain entities actually holding bitcoin value:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">uint64_t</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">uint64_t</span> <span class="n">script_len</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">uint8_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">script</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">bbp_txout_t</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code> field is the transferred bitcoin amount in satoshis, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script_len</code> (varint) plus <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> (byte array) fields are a vardata holding the output script code. The script contains the instructions to later redeem the output value. Within a transaction, each output has an index that is its offset in the outputs array.</p>

<h4 id="outpoint">Outpoint</h4>

<p>Any Bitcoin transaction that is not coinbase (read next section), must refer to one or more previously mined transactions, because what transactions do is moving coins from some outputs to others. Well, an <em>outpoint</em> is a fixed structure that expresses a pointer to an existing transaction output:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">uint8_t</span> <span class="n">txid</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="kt">uint32_t</span> <span class="n">index</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">bbp_outpoint_t</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">txid</code> field is the hash256 identifier of the referred transaction (little-endian), while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index</code> is the 0-based offset of the output in the transaction outputs array.</p>

<h4 id="input">Input</h4>

<p>A transaction input is an entity able to redeem value from a previously unspent output, also known as UTXO:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">bbp_outpoint_t</span> <span class="n">outpoint</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">uint64_t</span> <span class="n">script_len</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">uint8_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">script</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">uint32_t</span> <span class="n">sequence</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">bbp_txin_t</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outpoint</code> field is the pointer to the UTXO we want to spend. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script_len</code> (varint) plus <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script</code> (byte array) fields are a vardata holding the input script that, prepended to the UTXO script, is expected to succeed. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence</code> field is left for advanced operations, most of the time you’ll just set it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffffffff</code>.</p>

<h4 id="transaction">Transaction</h4>

<p>Now that all subcomponents were described, here’s the layout of a blockchain transaction:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">typedef</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">uint32_t</span> <span class="n">version</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">uint64_t</span> <span class="n">inputs_len</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">bbp_txin_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">inputs</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">uint64_t</span> <span class="n">outputs_len</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="n">bbp_txout_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">outputs</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">uint32_t</span> <span class="n">locktime</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="n">bbp_tx_t</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">version</code> of a transaction is established by network consensus and is currently constant <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>. I won’t cover <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">locktime</code> for now, just set it to zero. When serialized, the inputs and outputs arrays are prefixed with a varint announcing their count.</p>

<h3 id="serialization">Serialization</h3>

<p>To make things clearer, I want to show you how to serialize a transaction in code. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bbp_tx_serialize</code> function is taken from <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/basic-blockchain-programming/blob/master/tx.h">tx.h</a>:</p>

<p>Ignore the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flag</code> parameter and assume it’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> to skip the last <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> block.

<p>One last thing. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bbp_tx_serialize</code> function expects a properly allocated byte array, so you must use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bbp_tx_size</code> to get the exact amount of bytes required to serialize the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tx</code> transaction, for example:</p>

<h3 id="coinbase-transactions">Coinbase transactions</h3>

<p><em>Coinbase</em> transactions (which inspired the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> company name) are the only transactions without real inputs. They’re sort of genesis transactions, because they create bitcoins from nowhere and are not connected to any previous transaction. Each block in the blockchain has one and one only coinbase transaction that rewards the block miner with the famous ever-halving amount of bitcoins (currently 25 BTC).</p>

<p>Here’s an example <a href="https://blockstream.info/tx/e7472be34d36b9068e54466b4ef1d06456f65aa33aa78a4725278b6d37ebcb60">coinbase transaction</a> from Mainnet. It has a single output that sends a 25 BTC reward plus some fee to the following address:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1KFHE7w8BhaENAswwryaoccDb6qcT6DbYY
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>by using a standard P2PKH output script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_DUP
OP_HASH160

[c8 25 a1 ec f2 a6 83 0c
 44 01 62 0c 3a 16 f1 99
 50 57 c2 ab]

OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The push data element is exactly the above address properly Base58Check-decoded. Likewise, the transaction has only one input. Since a coinbase transaction creates bitcoins, its input doesn’t point to any previous UTXO. Typically, coinbase input scripts are placeholders for block metadata, like the block height in the blockchain, the name of the mining software, generic binary data etc.</p>

<h3 id="next-block-in-chain">Next block in chain?</h3>

<p>You learned the fundamental transaction data structures. Most transactions draw coins from previous outputs, while coinbase transactions generate coins from nowhere.</p>

<h3 id="the-validation-script">The validation script</h3>

<p>So far, we learned that a script is a piece of code that executes and yields a result. When building a transaction from an unspent transaction output (UTXO), there are two scripts we’re particularly interested in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The unspent output script, call it <em>OS</em>.</li>
  <li>The spending input script, call it <em>IS</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is producing such an <em>IS</em> that the concatenated script <em>VS</em> = <em>IS</em> + <em>OS</em> (the <em>validation script</em>), after being executed, returns a non-zero value. With this in mind, the validation script decides if the transaction input has right to spend the previous unspent output. It may sound difficult to understand, but it’s not.</p>

<p>Consider the input script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_6 OP_DUP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the previous output script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_ADD OP_12 OP_EQUAL
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now join them to have the following validation script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_6 OP_DUP OP_ADD OP_12 OP_EQUAL
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and see how the stack evolves:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[]
[6]
[6, 6]
[12]
[12, 12]
[1]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Fine, the validation script ends with 1 (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_TRUE</code>) on the stack, so the input script can spend the previous output script.</p>

<h4 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h4>

<p>In fact, many other input scripts comply, like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_4 OP_8
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_1 OP_15 OP_ADD OP_7 OP_SUB OP_3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See how anybody with some basic math knowledge could easily steal the output coins. Conversely, look at this very simple output script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_FALSE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No matter the input script, the validation script will never succeed. Any bitcoin sent to this output will be lost forever.</p>

<p>In fact, all the above scripts are dangerous and would be rejected by Mainnet for not being <em>standard</em>. Miners don’t accept transactions with non-standard scripts because in many situations they may result in money loss, directly or indirectly.</p>

<h3 id="standard-scripts">Standard scripts</h3>

<p>Virtually any kind of script can be included in a transaction. Still, only standard scripts will be accepted by Mainnet miners for security reasons. The “standard” term comes from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsStandard</code> check, a piece of code from Bitcoin Core ensuring that a script matches one of several well-known categories.</p>

<p>As of Bitcoin Core 0.10, these are considered standard scripts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>P2PKH (pay-to-public-key-hash)</li>
  <li>P2SH (pay-to-script-hash)</li>
  <li>P2PK (pay-to-public-key)</li>
  <li>Multisignature</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_RETURN</code> metadata</li>
</ol>

<p>In this course we’ll only treat the first ones. For your information, Testnet miners skip the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsStandard</code> check completely, thus making the Testnet network suitable for trying experimental scripts.</p>

<h3 id="p2pkh-scripts">P2PKH scripts</h3>

<p>The most common standard scripts in the blockchain are named after <a href="/basic-blockchain-programming/network-interoperability-part-two/">P2PKH addresses</a> (pay-to-public-key-hash). By having a destination P2PKH Bitcoin address, we can write an output script that will send coins to it. By having the private key from which the destination address was generated, we can write an input script that will later spend such coins.</p>

<h4 id="output-script">Output script</h4>

<p>A P2PKH output script contains a Base58Check-decoded destination address, that is the hash160 of an ECDSA public key:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_DUP
OP_HASH160
[hash160(public_key)]
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Take our sample compressed public key:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>02
82 00 6e 93 98 a6 98 6e
da 61 fe 91 67 4c 3a 10
8c 39 94 75 bf 1e 73 8f
19 df c2 db 11 db 1d 28
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and its hash160 digest:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>6b f1 9e 55 f9 4d 98 6b
46 40 c1 54 d8 64 69 93
41 91 95 11
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>that after Testnet versioning and Base58Check encoding is displayed as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mqMi3XYqsPvBWtrJTk8euPWDVmFTZ5jHuK
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output script that sends money to this address is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>76 (OP_DUP)
a9 (OP_HASH160)

14 6b f1 9e 55 f9 4d 98
6b 46 40 c1 54 d8 64 69
93 41 91 95 11

88 (OP_EQUALVERIFY)
ac (OP_CHECKSIG)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">14</code> is an implicit push opcode indicating there are 20 bytes coming next, namely the hash160 digest. The output script alone is meaningless without knowing the corresponding input script, so keep reading.</p>

<h4 id="input-script">Input script</h4>

<p>A P2PKH input script contains a DER-encoded ECDSA signature and a raw public key, either uncompressed or compressed. In such an input script, there are no opcodes other than pushes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[signature]
[public_key]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example, take the 70-bytes signature from the <a href="/basic-blockchain-programming/elliptic-curve-digital-signatures/">ECDSA chapter</a> and append the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGHASH_ALL</code> constant (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01</code>) to it:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>30 44
02 20
2b 2b 52 9b db dc 93 e7
8a f7 e0 02 28 b1 79 91
8b 03 2d 76 90 2f 74 ef
45 44 26 f7 d0 6c d0 f9
02 20
62 dd c7 64 51 cd 04 cb
56 7c a5 c5 e0 47 e8 ac
41 d3 d4 cf 7c b9 24 34
d5 5c b4 86 cc cf 6a f2
01
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGHASH</code> suffix is an advanced topic related to <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts">contracts</a>. In this series we’ll stick with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGHASH_ALL</code> because we’ll always sign all transaction inputs.</p>

<p>If you now take the public key from the previous paragraph, you have a typical input script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>47 30 44 02 20 2b 2b 52
9b db dc 93 e7 8a f7 e0
02 28 b1 79 91 8b 03 2d
76 90 2f 74 ef 45 44 26
f7 d0 6c d0 f9 02 20 62
dd c7 64 51 cd 04 cb 56
7c a5 c5 e0 47 e8 ac 41
d3 d4 cf 7c b9 24 34 d5
5c b4 86 cc cf 6a f2 01

21 02 82 00 6e 93 98 a6
98 6e da 61 fe 91 67 4c
3a 10 8c 39 94 75 bf 1e
73 8f 19 df c2 db 11 db
1d 28
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">47</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">21</code> are the hex lengths of the pushed signature and public key respectively.</p>

<h4 id="validation">Validation</h4>

<p>If we want to spend the money we received on our sample address, we must provide a specific input script so that the composite validation script succeeds. If the input is “authentic”, the following script will return non-zero:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[signature]
[public_key]
OP_DUP
OP_HASH160
[hash160(public_key)]
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A step by step description in case the input script is valid:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The input signature is pushed.</li>
  <li>The input public key is pushed.</li>
  <li>The top item (public key) is duplicated on the stack.</li>
  <li>The top item (public key) is hashed with hash160.</li>
  <li>The output hash160 is pushed.</li>
  <li>Input and output hash160 are popped then checked for equality.</li>
  <li>The input signature is verified against the public key.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_TRUE</code> is pushed as a result of successful signature verification.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s see what happens on the stack:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[]
[signature]
[signature, public_key]
[signature, public_key, public_key]
[signature, public_key, hash160(public_key)]
[signature, public_key, hash160(public_key), hash160(public_key)]
[signature, public_key]
[1]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The final stack holds <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_TRUE</code>, so the transaction input is legit. Along the road, two constraints were satisfied:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The public key in the input script must hash to the Bitcoin address in the output script (step 6).</li>
  <li>The signature must be valid for the public key (step 7).</li>
</ol>

<p>You may think that the input script alone is enough for signature verification, and you’d be wrong. I didn’t mention the third parameter of the verification process: the message! This is left for the next posts about transactions and, for your information, it’s going to be a tricky subject.</p>

<p>By the way, can you also see how important is to know if a private key is associated to an uncompressed or compressed public key? In case of “compression mismatch” between public keys and addresses, the first constraint would break. As a consequence, you cannot spend bitcoins sent to a compressed address with an input script containing an uncompressed public key, and vice versa.</p>

<h3 id="next-block-in-chain">Next block in chain?</h3>

<p>You learned that only a standard subset of all possible scripts are accepted by the Bitcoin network. P2PKH scripts are the most common standard scripts you’ll find in the blockchain. Input and output scripts together form validation scripts. Miners execute validation scripts to either accept or reject a transaction.</p>

<h3 id="meet-machine-code">Meet machine code</h3>

<p>A script is a computer program, and as a programmer you certainly know what a program is. A program takes an input, executes for some time, then returns an output. Programming languages are our tool to write programs that computers will understand, because most languages come with <em>compilers</em> that map human-friendly code to CPU operations, also known as <em>opcodes</em>.</p>

<h4 id="opcodes">Opcodes</h4>

<p>Opcodes include memory manipulation, math, loops, function calls and everything you find in procedural programming languages like C. They make up the spoken language of a CPU, the so-called <em>machine code</em>. Since bytes are computers’ preferred idiom, no wonder opcodes are bytes as well. As a result, machine code is a string of bytes representing operations to be executed on a CPU.</p>

<p>Consider this piece of code in a high-level programming language like C:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x23</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mh">0x4b</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*=</span> <span class="mh">0x1e</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now suppose you want to compile and run this code on a hypothetical little-endian CPU with a single cell of 16-bit memory (a <em>register</em>) and the following set of opcodes:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>encoding</th>
      <th>V</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>SET(V)</td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ab</code> V</td>
      <td>16-bit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ADD(V)</td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ac</code> V</td>
      <td>16-bit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MUL(V)</td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ad</code> V</td>
      <td>16-bit</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The opcodes explained:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SET loads the register with the value V.</li>
  <li>ADD adds V to the register.</li>
  <li>MUL multiplies the register by V.</li>
</ul>

<p>A compiler for such a CPU would generate these 9 bytes of machine code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ab 23 00 ac 4b 00 ad 1e 00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how it’s interpreted:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Load the register with the value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">23</code>.</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4b</code> to the register, that is now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">23 + 4b = 6e</code>.</li>
  <li>Multiply the register by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1e</code>, yielding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6e * 1e = ce4</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The register holds the final result, that is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ce4</code>.</p>

<h4 id="stack-memory">Stack memory</h4>

<p>Most of the time, we need to track complex program states with <em>variables</em>. In C, depending on whether a variable is allocated statically or with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">malloc</code>, it’s stored in a differently arranged memory. While <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">malloc</code>-ed data is accessed like an element in a very big array, static variables are pushed to and popped from a pile of items called <em>stack</em>. A stack operates in a LIFO fashion (Last In First Out), meaning that the last item you push will be the first to pop out.</p>

<p>Consider this dummy function:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="cm">/* 1 */</span>

    <span class="cm">/* 2 */</span>
    <span class="kt">uint8_t</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0x12</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kt">uint16_t</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0xa4</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>The stack is initially empty (1):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, three variables are pushed (2):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[12]
[12, a4 00]
[12, a4 00, e7 a5 02 00]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A fourth variable is assigned the sum of the others and pushed onto the stack (3):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[12, a4 00, e7 a5 02 00, 9d a6 02 00]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The tip of the stack is the return value and is sent back to the function caller by other means. Each temporary stack variable is popped at the end of the block (4), because the push/pop operations must be balanced so that the stack always goes back to its initial state:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[12, a4 00, e7 a5 02 00]
[12, a4 00]
[12]
[]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-script-machine-code">The Script machine code</h3>

<p>Likewise, Bitcoin Core has its own “virtual processor” to interpret the <em>Script</em> machine code. Script features a rich set of opcodes, yet very limited compared to full-fledged CPUs like Intel’s, to name one. Some key facts about Script:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Script does not loop.</li>
  <li>Script always terminates.</li>
  <li>Script memory access is stack-based.</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, point 1 implies 2. Point 3 means there’s no such thing like named variables in Script, you just do your calculations on a stack. Typically, the stack items you push become the operands of subsequent opcodes. At the end of the script, the top stack item is the return value.</p>

<p>Before presenting real world scripts, let’s first enumerate some opcodes. For a full set please check out the official <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">wiki page</a>.</p>

<h4 id="constants">Constants</h4>

<p>The following opcodes push the numbers 0-16 onto the stack:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>encoding</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_0</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">00</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_1</code>-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_16</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">51</code>-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">60</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>By convention, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_0</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_1</code> also express the boolean <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_FALSE</code> (zero) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_TRUE</code> (non-zero).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>54 57 00 60
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_4 OP_7 OP_0 OP_16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how the stack evolves:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[]
[4]
[4, 7]
[4, 7, 0]
[4, 7, 0, 16]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The return value is the top item, so the script returns 16. Quite pointless, I know, but it’s a start.</p>

<h4 id="push-data">Push data</h4>

<p>Several opcodes are provided to push custom data. They differ in the size of the operands:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>encoding</th>
      <th>L (length)</th>
      <th>D (data)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_PUSHDATA1</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4c</code> L D</td>
      <td>8-bit</td>
      <td>L bytes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_PUSHDATA2</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4d</code> L D</td>
      <td>16-bit</td>
      <td>L bytes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_PUSHDATA4</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4e</code> L D</td>
      <td>32-bit</td>
      <td>L bytes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For example, if your data length can be stored as a 8-bit number, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_PUSHDATA1</code> is your best choice. Look at this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>4c 14 11 06 03 55 04 8a
0c 70 3e 63 2e 31 26 30
24 06 6c 95 20 30
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first byte is clearly a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_PUSHDATA1</code> opcode, followed by a 1-byte length of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">14</code> that is decimal 20. So, 20 bytes of data are coming next. The effect of this instruction is that such data is pushed onto the stack:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[11 06 03 55 04 8a 0c 70
 3e 63 2e 31 26 30 24 06
 6c 95 20 30]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Indeed –like with <a href="/basic-blockchain-programming/serialization-part-two/">varints</a>–, there’s a special encoding for very short data. If an opcode lies between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4b</code> (included), it’s a push data operation where the opcode itself is the length in bytes:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>encoding</th>
      <th>L (length)</th>
      <th>D (data)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>L</td>
      <td>L D</td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01</code>-<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4b</code></td>
      <td>L bytes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For example, in the string:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>07 8f 49 b2 e2 ec 7c 44
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>the opcode <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">07</code> means that 7 bytes of data are to be pushed:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[8f 49 b2 e2 ec 7c 44]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You learned a little bit about machine code and opcodes. Script is a simple low-level language understood by miners software. Script state is tracked with stack memory.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/basic-blockchain-programming/bitcoin-script-language-part-two/">next article</a> I’ll show you opcodes that do something more than just pushing data.

<h4 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h4>

<p>Look at some of the many arithmetic opcodes:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>encoding</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_ADD</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">93</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_SUB</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">94</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Both are totally stack-based operations, meaning that they take no explicit argument. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_ADD</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_SUB</code>) pops the top two items of the stack and adds (substracts) them. The result of the operation is then pushed on top again.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>55 59 93 56 94
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OP_5 OP_9 OP_ADD OP_6 OP_SUB
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how the stack evolves:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[]
[5]
[5, 9]
[14]
[14, 6]
[8]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The script returns 8.</p>

<h4 id="comparison">Comparison</h4>

<p>Again, scripts are used for transaction validation, and comparisons are a primary need for a validator:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>encoding</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_EQUAL</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">87</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_EQUAL</code> pops and compares the top two items on the stack, then pushes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_TRUE</code> if they’re equal or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_FALSE</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>02 c3 72 02 03 72 01 c0 93 87
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[c3 72] [03 72] [c0] OP_ADD OP_EQUAL
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how the stack evolves:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[]
[c3 72]
[c3 72, 03 72]
[c3 72, 03 72, c0]
[c3 72, c3 72]
[1]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s worth noting that the script eventually “succeeds”, because it returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_TRUE</code>.</p>

<h4 id="stack-manipulation">Stack manipulation</h4>

<p>This is the only opcode you’re going to use for stack manipulation:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>encoding</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_DUP</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">76</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_DUP</code> takes no arguments, it just duplicates the top stack item.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>04 b9 0c a2 fe 76 87
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[b9 0c a2 fe] OP_DUP OP_EQUAL
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how the stack evolves:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[]
[b9 0c a2 fe]
[b9 0c a2 fe, b9 0c a2 fe]
[1]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Obviously, the script succeeds, since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_EQUAL</code> would never fail after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_DUP</code>!</p>

<h4 id="crypto">Crypto</h4>

<p>These opcodes are certainly the most interesting:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>opcode</th>
      <th>encoding</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_HASH160</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a9</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_CHECKSIG</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ac</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_HASH160</code> pops the top stack item, performs hash160 on it and then pushes the result back. Basically, this opcode computes the Bitcoin P2PKH address from an ECDSA public key.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_CHECKSIG</code> pops the top two stack items, the first being an ECDSA public key and the second being a DER-encoded ECDSA signature. After that, it pushes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_TRUE</code> if the signature is valid for that public key or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OP_FALSE</code> otherwise. It’s the Script version of OpenSSL’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ECDSA_verify</code>.</p>

<p>Both opcodes will be described in the next post.</p>

<h3 id="wheres-the-code">Where’s the code?</h3>

<p>There are no code examples in this chapter. In the end a script is an array of data where your only contribution is mapping opcodes names to raw bytes. We could have developed a tiny Script interpreter, but it’s way beyond our goals. Typical Bitcoin clients don’t run scripts as it’s a mining task, so our concern is just writing well-formed scripts that miners would accept.</p>

<h3 id="next-block-in-chain">Next block in chain?</h3>

<p>You learned some more Script opcodes, including crypto functions essential to ECDSA verifications.</p>
