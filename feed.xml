Add to that, you may never use most of the well-known patterns, and it’s okay because you don’t want to be a hammer looking for a nail. You shouldn’t force a design pattern for the sake of using it.</p>

<p><a href="#how-di-helps-me-scale-passepartout">Below</a>, I’ll show you how a popular design pattern helped me rework Passepartout for Mac to distribute it <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/issues/231">outside of the App Store</a>, without messing too much with the existing and stable codebase.</p>

<h3 id="experience-produces-patterns">Experience produces patterns</h3>

<p>Patterns are simply an outcome of your programming experience, in that you recognize a common problem for which a common solution also exists. Yet, the amount of buzzwords in the online communities around what some erroneously call “architectures” is ridiculous –the MVVM acronym being the one I stand the least–, to the point that the poor newcomers may feel intimidated. The risk of being ostracized for not using “the right name for the thing” is real, even if the same thing could be named differently as soon as you visit a different community.</p>

<p>But hey, listen, the reality is brighter: compilers don’t give a damn about the name you give to your grand architectures. The only names that matter, at the end of the day, are those coming from the syntax of the programming language you use.</p>

<h3 id="popular-design-patterns">Popular design patterns</h3>

<p>Some design patterns are especially popular, and their names are <em>de facto</em> universal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder">Builder</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command">Command</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method">Factory</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton">Singleton</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy">Strategy</a></li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>You’re bound to cross them at least once in your lifetime. If you like practice more than theory, you definitely used any of the above without the need to give them a name. These patterns are undoubtly useful, they resolve basic architectural problems and, contrary to some beliefs, by no means are they tied to OOP.</p>

<p>Then there is <em>Dependency Injection</em> (DI). I hate giving this one a name, but there it is. More than a design pattern, DI is an <em>approach</em> to making software. I call it that way to avoid the terrible mistake of thinking that there is only one way to do it. I mean, if you’re a Java programmer, you don’t need the <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring Framework</a> to do DI.</p>

<p>Here’s how I like to phrase it: <strong>DI is the act of decoupling your software from the underlying implementations of its dependencies.</strong></p>

<h3 id="how-di-helps-me-scale-passepartout">How DI helps me scale Passepartout</h3>

<p>Weeks ago, I decided to make Passepartout for Mac available <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/issues/231">outside of the App Store</a>. Making such a VPN app standalone is no trivial task because the way it operates is radically different: the UI is still a frontend to the VPN backend, but the app and the VPN processes execute as different users, and they do not easily communicate. Specifically, the VPN is deployed as <a href="apple-sysex">System Extension</a>, and therefore runs as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code>.</p>

<p>By leaving the App Store, I was about to lose a big chunk of features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>App Groups: required for app/VPN IPC (inter-process communication), data sharing, and logs</li>
  <li>Shared keychain: used to persist the VPN profiles</li>
  <li>In-app purchases</li>
  <li>iCloud</li>
</ul>

<p>In-app purchases and iCloud could be postponed by stripping paid features, but the core functionality of Passepartout relied on both App Groups and the shared keychain. I hit a tough blocker.</p>

<p>Here’s where DI comes to the rescue: <strong>you don’t change the business logic of your software</strong>, you rather change <em>how</em> that logic is implemented deep down in the leaves of the dependency tree. I still wanted to “share data between the app and the VPN process” (business logic), but I needed to change <em>how</em> that data was shared (dependency). Remember, this isolation is only possible if the two concerns are sharply separated, but this is the core principle behind DI.</p>

<p>The core library of Passepartout, <em>Partout,</em> is 100% pure Swift for this reason: the logic of the library is always the same, with the “low-level” implementations abstracted as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protocol</code>s, and for which the app is free to provide (inject) <em>truly</em> different implementations. In my case, it turned out that I could just craft new implementations for the standalone Mac app, whereas anything else would stay untouched.</p>

<h3 id="swap-out-the-broken-pieces">Swap out the broken pieces</h3>

<p>The process is fairly simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For each dependency, identify the “broken” implementation of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protocol</code></li>
  <li>Write a new implementation, compatible with the target</li>
  <li>Unit test behavior as per the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protocol</code> pre/post conditions</li>
  <li>Swap the unsupported implementation with the new one</li>
</ul>

<p>After these steps, passing the tests would imply that the app will work like before, but regardless of being downloaded from the App Store or not. I can’t tell how thrilling it is when you see the magic of programming in action. This is a real-world situation where good practices and constant refactoring pay off.</p>

<p>The new Mac app eventually works around the missing functionalities by dynamically replacing (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">supportsAppGroups</code> is false in this case):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/partout/blob/master/Sources/Platforms/Apple/UserDefaultsEnvironment.swift"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UserDefaultsEnvironment</code></a> with <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/partout/blob/master/Sources/Platforms/AppleNE/App/NETunnelEnvironment.swift"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NETunnelEnvironment</code></a>, which does IPC by sending messages to the System Extension, rather than sharing data through the App Group <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UserDefaults</code>.

<p>You’d better follow the DI approach early in your software development, but not immediately, because you may never need to convert a code module into a pluggable dependency.

As I said in the beginning, you shouldn’t use a solution for a problem you don’t have, and most projects don’t need bulky external third parties to deal with their trivial dependencies.

Here I show you those I stumbled upon, and how I worked around some limitations of the bare Swift toolchain.</p>

<h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2>

<p>Have you ever compiled Swift code without importing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code></a>? Do you even think it’s possible? Look at the most basic Swift template in Xcode:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">//</span>
<span class="c1">//  File.swift</span>
<span class="c1">//  Passepartout</span>
<span class="c1">//</span>
<span class="c1">//  Created by Davide De Rosa on 5/5/25.</span>
<span class="c1">//</span>

<span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">Foundation</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which in Objective-C would be:</p>

<div class="language-objective_c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">//</span>
<span class="c1">//  File.m</span>
<span class="c1">//  Passepartout</span>
<span class="c1">//</span>
<span class="c1">//  Created by Davide De Rosa on 5/5/25.</span>
<span class="c1">//</span>

<span class="cp">#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s cut it short to the bad news: <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code> is not part of the Swift language</strong>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code> is, however, available as an import in the prebuilt Swift toolchains for non-Apple platforms. Why is that? Over the years, those pseudo-implicit imports may have convinced most of us that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code> has always been a standard library. First, as an Objective-C wrapper of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CoreFoundation</code></a>. Later, as an integral part of Swift.</p>

<p>The maintainers of the otherwise modern Apple language are well aware of this heavy legacy, so they created a replacement for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code> that is not bound to the Apple SDK. Beware that if you build the Swift toolchain by yourself, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code> is not included by default. This tells me that maybe, <em>maybe</em>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code> will also depart from Swift someday. You were warned.</p>

<p>Below are a few <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code> entities that many developers are familiar with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data</code> for binary data (bridging ObjC <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSData</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Date</code> for dates and timestamps (briding ObjC <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSDate</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UUID</code> for unique identifiers</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSONEncoder</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSONDecoder</code> (these are pure Swift)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URL</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URLSession</code> and tasks (bridigng ObjC <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURL</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSURLSession</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FileManager</code></li>
  <li>A bunch of other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS</code>-prefixed stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code> import is not as a comprehensive as on Apple. This new version has opt-in modules due to the dependencies that they imply:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FoundationNetworking</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URL</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URLSession</code>, due to the dependency on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libcurl</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FoundationXML</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XMLParser</code>, due to the dependency on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libxml2</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Can you get rid of all this stuff already? I doubt you can, unless you started a new project knowing these gotchas beforehand. In my case, I need to keep the burden of this non-standard library, at least until Swift will have a richer standard library.</p>

<p>Last but not least, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code> comes with the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch">Grand Central Dispatch</a> API, but listen to me: it’s time you learn <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/concurrency"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Concurrency</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="swift-standard-library">Swift standard library</h2>

<p>You heard that, Swift has a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift-standard-library"><em>standard library</em></a>, but few would be able to delineate its boundaries. The Apple documentation certainly doesn’t help when figuring out what comes from the language, and what comes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code>.</p>

<p>A partial list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Primitive types: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bool</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Int</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Double</code>, …, but <em>not</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Date</code>!</li>
  <li>Protocols: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Comparable</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Equatable</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hashable</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Identifiable</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Codable</code>, …</li>
  <li>Collections: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Array</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dictionary</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Collection</code>, …</li>
  <li>Flow constructs: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Result</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Error</code></li>
  <li>String description protocols: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomStringConvertible</code> and variations</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank God, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Concurrency</code> is also part of the library.</p>

<h2 id="platform-specific-packages">Platform-specific packages</h2>

<p>When developing on macOS, you may notice that standard C functions are implicitly bridged to Swift code. This autocompletion is proof:</p>

<p><img src="/s/f/cross-platform-swift/core-libraries-xcode-c-autocompletion.png" alt="C autocompletion of memcpy in Xcode" /></p>

<p>The other Swift environments behave differently, and honestly, I prefer it that way. I’d rather import things explicitly when needed. Therefore, the compiler will stop at C symbols in Swift code out of the box. Windows in particular doesn’t follow the POSIX naming, and some symbols come from very differently named headers. For example, the first symbol that triggered a compiler failure for me was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AF_INET</code>, which on Windows is part of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WinSock2.h</code>.</p>

<p>While the header names are relevant in C code, Swift remains a bit more agnostic by hiding them behind platform-specific packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import WinSDK</code> on Windows</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import Linux</code> on Linux</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import Android</code> on Android</li>
</ul>

<p>The imports still require some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#if</code> conditionals here and there. At that point, you may run into a few C symbols that are only available on Apple platforms, like any variation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSEC_PER_*</code> in my library. In that case, you can redefine those symbols yourself, or refactor the code to not use them at all.</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed is name clashes. To name one, Windows seems to have a name clash on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UUID</code> (alias for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GUID</code> in Win32), which I resolved this way:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#if os(Windows)</span>
<span class="kd">import</span> <span class="kt">WinSDK</span>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">typealias</span> <span class="kt">UUID</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Foundation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="kt">UUID</span>
<span class="cp">#endif</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The need for the Objective-C runtime in your Swift code may be incredibly subtle. Look at a linker error I faced:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>lld-link: error: undefined symbol: objc_autoreleaseReturnValue
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I was lucky to catch the issue in a place where the compiler could not provide any hint. The culprit was a class of the Partout API that was using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JavaScriptCore</code></a> framework, which in turn required Swift closures to be Objective-C blocks to inject custom functions into the JavaScript code. If you’ve never seen that, here’s a bit of the offending code:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">inject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"getText"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">object</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getText</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="kd">@convention</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">block</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Any</span><span class="p">?)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Frankly, I wondered why the code compiled at all, so I tried to put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@objc</code> on top of a Swift class on Linux:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>File.swift:1:2: error: Objective-C interoperability is disabled
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gosh, then why does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@convention(block)</code> compile on non-Apple, if the linker is always bound to fail? I have no idea, but look at your code carefully if it compiles fine but the linker complains about some Objective-C runtime or obscure <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NS*</code> entity.</p>

<p>Fun fact: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JavaScriptCore</code> is an Objective-C framework with iOS 16 as the <em>minimum target</em>, which deceived me into seeing it as a “new thing”.</p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom line</h2>

<p>Stick with pure Swift as much as you can, and when you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foundation</code>, do it with a grain of salt: the Swift standard library is much smaller than you think. Spot any Objective-C sorcery, and kill it for good.</p>

Here I show you those I stumbled upon, and how I worked around some limitations of the bare Swift toolchain. Foundation Have you ever compiled Swift code without importing Foundation? Do you even think it’s possible? Look at the most basic Swift template in Xcode: // // File.swift // Passepartout // // Created by Davide De Rosa on 5/5/25. // import Foundation which in Objective-C would be: // // File.m // Passepartout // // Created by Davide De Rosa on 5/5/25. // #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt; Let’s cut it short to the bad news: Foundation is not part of the Swift language. Foundation is, however, available as an import in the prebuilt Swift toolchains for non-Apple platforms. Why is that? Over the years, those pseudo-implicit imports may have convinced most of us that Foundation has always been a standard library. First, as an Objective-C wrapper of CoreFoundation. Later, as an integral part of Swift. The maintainers of the otherwise modern Apple language are well aware of this heavy legacy, so they created a replacement for Foundation that is not bound to the Apple SDK. Beware that if you build the Swift toolchain by yourself, Foundation is not included by default. This tells me that maybe, maybe, Foundation will also depart from Swift someday. You were warned. Below are a few Foundation entities that many developers are familiar with: Data for binary data (bridging ObjC NSData) Date for dates and timestamps (briding ObjC NSDate) UUID for unique identifiers JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder (these are pure Swift) URL, URLSession and tasks (bridigng ObjC NSURL and NSURLSession) FileManager A bunch of other NS-prefixed stuff The Foundation import is not as a comprehensive as on Apple. This new version has opt-in modules due to the dependencies that they imply: FoundationNetworking for URL and URLSession, due to the dependency on libcurl FoundationXML for XMLParser, due to the dependency on libxml2 Can you get rid of all this stuff already? I doubt you can, unless you started a new project knowing these gotchas beforehand. In my case, I need to keep the burden of this non-standard library, at least until Swift will have a richer standard library. Last but not least, Foundation comes with the Grand Central Dispatch API, but listen to me: it’s time you learn Concurrency. Swift standard library You heard that, Swift has a standard library, but few would be able to delineate its boundaries. The Apple documentation certainly doesn’t help when figuring out what comes from the language, and what comes from Foundation. A partial list: Primitive types: Bool, Int, String, Double, …, but not Data or Date! Protocols: Comparable, Equatable, Hashable, Identifiable, Codable, … Collections: Array, Dictionary, Set, Collection, … Flow constructs: Result, Error String description protocols: CustomStringConvertible and variations Thank God, Concurrency is also part of the library. Platform-specific packages When developing on macOS, you may notice that standard C functions are implicitly bridged to Swift code. This autocompletion is proof: The other Swift environments behave differently, and honestly, I prefer it that way. I’d rather import things explicitly when needed. Therefore, the compiler will stop at C symbols in Swift code out of the box. Windows in particular doesn’t follow the POSIX naming, and some symbols come from very differently named headers. For example, the first symbol that triggered a compiler failure for me was AF_INET, which on Windows is part of WinSock2.h. While the header names are relevant in C code, Swift remains a bit more agnostic by hiding them behind platform-specific packages: import WinSDK on Windows import Linux on Linux import Android on Android The imports still require some #if conditionals here and there. At that point, you may run into a few C symbols that are only available on Apple platforms, like any variation of NSEC_PER_* in my library. In that case, you can redefine those symbols yourself, or refactor the code to not use them at all. Another thing I noticed is name clashes. To name one, Windows seems to have a name clash on UUID (alias for GUID in Win32), which I resolved this way: #if os(Windows) import WinSDK public typealias UUID = Foundation.UUID #endif There might be more similar occurrences, but you can get around them with conditionals and forced typealias.

<p>This story is somewhat related to what I’m trying now that I work full-time on <a href="https://passepartoutvpn.app">Passepartout</a>. Passepartout is an open-source project in that its code is public, but there are almost no code contributions, just issues. There are good reasons behind this.</p>

<p>Many of those who improvise some sort of open-source software think that it must be interesting by default, just because it’s open and available for free.

<p>For example, pick any GNU tool (grep, sed, make, …) or even Linux. They became popular because they were <em>useful</em>. Being free and <em>understandable</em> software made them thrive through public contributions, but this was never the first step.</p>

  <li>Technical stack</li>
  <li>Stable software architecture</li>

<p>Now, observe how any well-known free software meets 1-5 in that order.</p>

In fact, I don’t think that Vim today can claim being cooler than Neovim other than for being the original one.</p>

<p>Even if a software is well-crafted, it’s evident that a Pascal application will only attract a handful of developers, whereas JavaScript would open up to the entire globe, and the same applies to Vimscript versus Lua. If your software is written for yourself and requires developers to learn a new technology to contribute, either it is the most remarkable piece of art in software history, or you might well end up yelling at your echo chamber.</p>

<p>The Vim story taught me that I needed to make my project more accessible to the potential contributors, otherwise it will never be more than a one-man team.</p>

<p>While I invest a lot in making the software architecture as modular as I can, I haven’t spent as much time in documenting <em>how</em> to start contributing to the codebase. I know myself how intimidating it is to submit a PR to someone else’s repository, so it’s crucial that we, the maintainers, provide a viable entry point to those willing to collaborate. A welcoming, non-judging community also reduces the friction of the first public contribution.</p>

<p>One part that I’ve always found potentially accessible was the Providers API, which is how Passepartout auto-compiles VPN configurations for a plethora of provider servers.

Once you manage to just compile your package, the worst is definitely behind you.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this is not a series about how to port Apple frameworks or SwiftUI to other platforms, it’s about the bare Swift language. I want to show you how Xcode may trick you into thinking that some patterns are a key part of Swift, whereas they should be avoided if you plan to leave the Apple ecosystem at some point.</p>

<p>Today, I’ll talk about a kind of infamous framework for Swift developers: <em>Combine</em>.</p>

<h2 id="combine-is-unofficially-obsolete">Combine is unofficially obsolete</h2>

<p>When the compiler suddenly stopped at some occurrence of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import Combine</code>, I was beaten. Combine has been a fundamental piece of reactive programming for the last 5+ years, and any recent Swift codebase uses Combine to some extent. The scary question was: to what extent was I using it?</p>

<p>Let me digress a moment. There is a big problem with Combine, and it’s not about the developers using it. Apple is well-known for disrupting its own frameworks regardless of any backward-compatibility, and Combine is one of those examples where Apple took a different turn without offering a full replacement. Initially, it seemed that SwiftUI was all about Combine, but the introduction of Concurrency made the poor framework an outcast. Unsurprisingly, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ObservableObject</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Published</code> are also unavailable outside Apple Swift, but if you’ve been a diligent programmer, you’ve probably learned that those constructs only make sense with SwiftUI.</p>

<p>The fact that Combine has never been integrated into the Swift language, reveals that Concurrency is how Swift (and Apple) wants you to perform asynchronous programming from now on. Does Swift natively offer a substitute for the long list of Combine operators? Hell, no, and that’s why people still use Combine.</p>

<p>Back to my question. Luckily, my use of Combine in Partout was quite basic, except for one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.combineLatest3()</code> that was worth half the effort.</p>

<h2 id="porting-to-asyncsequence">Porting to AsyncSequence</h2>

<p>If you remember, the purpose of Combine is manipulating a sequence of asynchronous values. Swift offers implementations of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncsequence"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsyncSequence</code></a> like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncstream"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsyncStream</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/asyncthrowingstream"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsyncThrowingStream</code></a> to accomplish the same in a linear fashion, typical of the async/await model.</p>

<p>What in Combine was:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">subscription</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">somePublisherOfStrings</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1">// AnyPublisher&lt;String, Never&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">removeDuplicates</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sink</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="k">weak</span> <span class="k">self</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">in</span>
        <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"String: </span><span class="se">\(</span><span class="nv">$0</span><span class="se">)</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>becomes this with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsyncStream</code>:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">subscription</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">Task</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="k">weak</span> <span class="k">self</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">in</span>
    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">previous</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span><span class="p">?</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nf">someStreamOfStrings</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">// AsyncStream&lt;String&gt;</span>
        <span class="k">guard</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="n">previous</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">continue</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"String: </span><span class="se">\(</span><span class="nv">$0</span><span class="se">)</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">previous</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">string</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, a typical way to spawn Combine publishers is with <em>subjects</em> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PassthroughSubject</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CurrentValueSubject</code>), that are multicast emitters of values. Multiple programs can subscribe to a subject, listen to its sequence of values, and manipulate them before delivery with the rich offer of Combine operators. We lack such a counterpart in Swift, so I went to <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/subject-streams">roll out my own</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/subject-streams/blob/master/Sources/SubjectStreams/PassthroughStream.swift"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PassthroughStream</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/subject-streams/blob/master/Sources/SubjectStreams/CurrentValueStream.swift"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CurrentValueStream</code></a> implement a simple pub/sub pattern with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsyncStream</code> and strict Swift 6.1 Concurrency. They have become the building blocks of all my asynchronous publishers in cross-platform Swift, and by keeping behavior and naming close to Combine (e.g. the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.send()</code> method), the refactoring was easier to manage.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replace Combine subjects with <a href="https://github.com/keeshux/subject-streams"><em>subject streams</em></a></li>
  <li>Return an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AsyncStream</code> from a subject with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.subscribe()</code></li>
  <li>Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AnyCancellable</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Task</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for [try] await</code> loops (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weak self</code> here)</li>
</ul>

Once you manage to just compile your package, the worst is definitely behind you. Keep in mind that this is not a series about how to port Apple frameworks or SwiftUI to other platforms, it’s about the bare Swift language. I want to show you how Xcode may trick you into thinking that some patterns are a key part of Swift, whereas they should be avoided if you plan to leave the Apple ecosystem at some point. Today, I’ll talk about a kind of infamous framework for Swift developers: Combine. Combine is unofficially obsolete When the compiler suddenly stopped at some occurrence of import Combine, I was beaten. Combine has been a fundamental piece of reactive programming for the last 5+ years, and any recent Swift codebase uses Combine to some extent. The scary question was: to what extent was I using it? Let me digress a moment. There is a big problem with Combine, and it’s not about the developers using it. Apple is well-known for disrupting its own frameworks regardless of any backward-compatibility, and Combine is one of those examples where Apple took a different turn without offering a full replacement. Initially, it seemed that SwiftUI was all about Combine, but the introduction of Concurrency made the poor framework an outcast. Unsurprisingly, ObservableObject and @Published are also unavailable outside Apple Swift, but if you’ve been a diligent programmer, you’ve probably learned that those constructs only make sense with SwiftUI. The fact that Combine has never been integrated into the Swift language, reveals that Concurrency is how Swift (and Apple) wants you to perform asynchronous programming from now on. Does Swift natively offer a substitute for the long list of Combine operators? Hell, no, and that’s why people still use Combine. Back to my question. Luckily, my use of Combine in Partout was quite basic, except for one .combineLatest3() that was worth half the effort. Porting to AsyncSequence If you remember, the purpose of Combine is manipulating a sequence of asynchronous values. Swift offers implementations of AsyncSequence like AsyncStream and AsyncThrowingStream to accomplish the same in a linear fashion, typical of the async/await model. What in Combine was: subscription = somePublisherOfStrings() // AnyPublisher&lt;String, Never&gt; .removeDuplicates() .sink { [weak self] in print("String: \($0)") } becomes this with AsyncStream: subscription = Task { [weak self] in var previous: String? for await string in someStreamOfStrings() { // AsyncStream&lt;String&gt; guard string != previous else { continue } print("String: \($0)") previous = string } } Now, a typical way to spawn Combine publishers is with subjects (PassthroughSubject and CurrentValueSubject), that are multicast emitters of values. Multiple programs can subscribe to a subject, listen to its sequence of values, and manipulate them before delivery with the rich offer of Combine operators. We lack such a counterpart in Swift, so I went to roll out my own. My PassthroughStream and CurrentValueStream implement a simple pub/sub pattern with AsyncStream and strict Swift 6.1 Concurrency. They have become the building blocks of all my asynchronous publishers in cross-platform Swift, and by keeping behavior and naming close to Combine (e.g. the .send() method), the refactoring was easier to manage. Steps: Replace Combine subjects with subject streams Return an AsyncStream from a subject with .subscribe() Replace AnyCancellable with Task and for [try] await loops (weak self here) Before: final class RandomGenerator { private let generator = PassthroughSubject&lt;Int, Never&gt;() var publisher: AnyPublisher&lt;Int, Never&gt; { generator.eraseToAnyPublisher() } func run() { generator.send(.random(in: 1...1000)) } } ... let prng = RandomGenerator() var subscription = prng.publisher.sink { [weak self] value in ... } After: final class RandomGenerator { private let generator = PassthroughStream&lt;Int&gt;() var publisher: AsyncStream&lt;Int&gt; { generator.subscribe() } func run() { generator.send(.random(in: 1...1000)) } } ... let prng = RandomGenerator() var subscription = Task { [weak self] in for await value in prng.publisher { ... } } Bottom line Leaving Combine behind is a disruptive step towards both Swift 6 and cross-platform. Personally, I still don’t fully trust the behavior of AsyncSequence, but what are we left with? Apple is forcing developers towards Concurrency, and soon there will be no choice but to embrace it. And I’m glad, because it’s finally bringing consistency to the language. We’re close to building the Partout core on both Windows and Linux.

<h2 id="leaving-the-apple-toolchain">Leaving the Apple toolchain</h2>

<p>I picked Windows as the starting point of my journey. Windows is as far as one can go with Swift, so if my library works there, porting it to Android and Linux should be easier. In this post I’ll outline some fundamental principles to keep in mind before touching any code.</p>

<p><em>Downloading Swift with WinGet</em>
<img src="/s/posts/2025-04-13-01.png" alt="Downloading Swift with WinGet" /></p>

<h3 id="1-start-with-a-lean-core">1. Start with a lean core</h3>

<p>When I made Partout from the ashes of <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit">TunnelKit</a>, I put special care into making the library core as lean as possible. No dependencies, no OS implementations, pure Swift. This mantra paid off very well in the long run because you realize how basic the Swift runtime is when you leave the comfortable macOS environment: a stripped version of the Foundation and Dispatch frameworks, not even Combine, and little more. I promise, this will hit you hard the first time.</p>

<p>I was equally shocked, yet positively, when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async</code> methods worked out of the box. This is not about Swift, though, rather about Windows. The level of discomfort I feel when I use Windows puts me in a constant disbelief when things, eventually, work as intended. As in “this is Windows, nothing can work without Visual Studio”. Fun fact: Swift requires the Visual Studio Build Tools.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge #1: Only depend on Foundation.</strong></p>

<h3 id="2-objc-no-thanks">2. ObjC? No, thanks</h3>

<p>Another painful wake-up call: the Swift toolchain does not support ObjC targets in SwiftPM on non-Apple. There are three scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you depend on 3rd party Swift packages based on ObjC code, move on to something else. Most of the time there will be better options.</li>
  <li>If you need to write low-level code with Swift, prefer some well-crafted C routines. You’ll thank yourself later.</li>
  <li>If you (like me) have legacy ObjC code –a good amount of my OpenVPN implementation is written in ObjC for performance reasons–, hear me out: it’s going to cause you trouble.</li>
</ol>

<p>As far as I can tell, there are no easy shortcuts to resolve point 3. Keep in mind that the first challenge still applies: pray that your ObjC codebase only depends on Foundation or libraries that <em>you</em> bundle –thus excluding Apple frameworks, or you’re basically screwed.</p>

<p>Assuming that this is the case, you should treat ObjC like any other “foreign” language, which is with an external build tool. Once you build the ObjC code as a static library (e.g. with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code>), you have the option to add it as a binary target to the SwiftPM manifest. The same way you would do with Rust or Go, to name some. Unfortunately, this degrades the otherwise neat automation of SwiftPM.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m exploring a solution to reuse my ObjC code as is with <a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/">MinGW64</a> and <a href="https://www.gnustep.org/">GNUstep</a>, as you can see in the screenshot below (forgive my swearing after hours of frustrating attempts…). So far, so good, though I’m still concerned with how MSYS2/MinGW64 handles the binary architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge #2: Prefer C over ObjC, if you can.</strong></p>

<p><em>Compiling ObjC with MinGW + GNUstep</em>
<img src="/s/posts/2025-04-13-02.png" alt="Compiling ObjC with MinGW + GNUstep" /></p>

<h3 id="3-implementations">3. Implementations</h3>

<p>I still want to use the keychain and Network Extension on Apple systems. A lean core will inevitably lead to taking Swift targets depending on them out of the core and be imported conditionally. These are the “leaves” of the library, the ones where we have the most freedom, even on the programming language.</p>

<p>When it comes to Partout, this is of the utmost importance because it involves how the VPN functionality is implemented on each operating system. While this is clear to me on Apple (Network Extension), for Windows, I’m looking into the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/UwpVpnPluginSample">Universal Windows Platform (UWP)</a>. As proof of the freedom we have in this area, the VPN code for Partout on Windows will likely be C#.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge #3: Isolate implementation targets.</strong></p>

<h3 id="4-c-is-the-common-denominator">4. C is the common denominator</h3>

<p>Sad to say, but it doesn’t really matter how cool your Swift library is (replace with any other language). The well-thought classes, the scalable design, the smart patterns, the tricky use of OOP: forget about any of those by the time you expose the library to a different programming language. Nobody cares, really, because interoperability is done in C.</p>

<p>Have you wondered how to expose a Swift protocol with an associatedtype to a Python library, an object with a lifetime, or even just a String? Well, the answer is straightforward: you don’t do that. Instead, you expose C wrappers from Swift with <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/formalizing-cdecl/40677">@_cdecl</a>, which despite the leading underscore seems to be widely accepted as a pseudostable feature. It goes without saying, you will be limited to the standard C types.</p>

<p>This will be a late stage of the refactoring, today I’m not worried. A solid approach to challenge #1 would definitely make this easier.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge #4: Make your public interface a C API.</strong></p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom line</h2>

<p>I’m still in the early stages of bringing Swift to Windows, Android, and Linux with Partout, but the path is starting to reveal itself. Keep your core lean and pure Swift, avoid Objective-C where you can, isolate OS-specific implementations, and remember that C is the common ground across platforms. It’s experimental, sometimes frustrating, but genuinely fun—and worth sharing as it unfolds. Expect more on this throughout 2025.</p>]]></content><author><name>Davide De Rosa</name></author><category term="development" /><category term="swift" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Partout, my Swift framework for VPN and network configuration on Apple devices, has slowly gained shape, I set foot in an ambitious and novel, pioneering goal: making Partout a truly multiplatform Swift library.

If you try to argue that tech <em>does</em> matter in a tech-oriented product, they will tell you that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business is more important than engineering</li>
  <li>Software is useless if it doesn’t make money</li>

  <li>Devices are powerful, performance doesn’t matter</li>

</ul>

<p>And many more dumb takes. This is the typical mentality by which consultancy firms produce the most mediocre products you will ever find.</p>

<p>I don’t want to delve into this endless – and hopeless – topic. Instead, I want to tell you a little story of how easy it is to lose control of software <em>performance</em>, and how the understanding of programming fundamentals keeps us in touch with reality. This has never been more important with the fast-paced opportunities that LLMs offer today.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-afford-low-performance">Can you afford low performance?</h3>

<p>I’m far from being a low-level programmer, yet I know C and the fundamentals of how things happen below the code.</p>

<p><a href="https://passepartoutvpn.app">Passepartout</a> is a networking app mostly dealing with VPN connections. At least in the tunnel context, performance <em>does</em> matter. When it comes to OpenVPN in particular, it’s very hard to compete with a pure C codebase – the official library – when you also have to account for the overhead of the Swift runtime. Let’s not forget about the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/73148">strict memory limits</a> of Network Extension either. The time I spent on profiling to improve efficiency, resolve memory leaks, and reduce the crash rate, among other things, is pretty massive.</p>

<p>Two months ago, a user reported a regression in the OpenVPN negotiation where the handshake would never complete. I could implement a fix quickly, yet the handshake took 4x longer than with the obsolete TunnelKit. A whopping and unacceptable 20-25s vs 5s negotiation!</p>

<h3 id="the-domino-effect-of-bad-choices">The domino effect of bad choices</h3>

<p>I inspected the negotiation steps carefully for bottlenecks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Loops</li>
  <li>Blocking code</li>
  <li>Slow I/O</li>
  <li>Disputed locks</li>
  <li>Wrong artificial delays</li>
  <li>Parsing</li>
  <li>…and whatnot!</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if your life as a programmer only revolved around high-level languages like JavaScript, Python, or even Swift, you will have a hard time realizing the <em>time cost</em> – not the <em>O(n)</em> cost – of your code. Similar to how knowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> helps immensely when profiling a slow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORM</a>, knowing C helps you spot poor performance in high-level programs, even if you never get to write C code.</p>

<p>It took me 1-2 days to realize that the culprit was ironically where I expected it the least. The performance hit was caused by <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/pull/1095">the parser of the PUSH_REPLY</a> message, which is a short comma-separated string. To be fair, the parser is quite basic, so it wasn’t the parser either: the problem was about <strong>re-creating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSRegularExpression</code> objects every time a new PUSH_REPLY was parsed</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, it doesn’t take a lot to create an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSRegularExpression</code> but the user’s server sent dozens of PUSH_REPLY messages to the client, so the slow code was adding up very quickly. Run a 100ms vs 500ms code once and it will be okay, but run it 20 times and you easily get a 2 seconds vs 10 seconds delay. In the vast majority of servers, the PUSH_REPLY is a single message, which made the nasty issue unnoticeable to most.</p>

<p>By then, I realized how too much OOP makes us programmers forget that even creating objects may be expensive. Imagine what AI can do without a supervisor. When performance is crucial, we should remind ourselves that the convenient, good-looking solution might be the <em>worse</em> choice.</p>

<h3 id="what-vibe-coders-may-not-be-ready-for">What “vibe coders” may not be ready for</h3>

<p>Before anything, ask yourself what <em>your business</em> is about. If you work at Netflix, or in the game industry, you might observe the immediate effect of an inefficient vibe-coded algorithm. In the trivial CRUD apps that make up 99.9% of the consultancy workforce, instead, you may only realize that your code has low performance after a long chain of bad choices, if ever.</p>

<p>Performance, however, is just an example of what’s being overseen due to the increasingly fast pace at which people produce code.</p>

<p>This leads to a few observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your software is “stupid”, low performance may only be hidden and therefore not seem a big deal.</li>
  <li>Engineers who underestimate the importance of performant solutions, probably never worked on challenging projects.</li>
  <li>If performance doesn’t matter to <em>you</em> today, it doesn’t mean it’s not important in general. Or, that it won’t be important when <em>your</em> business scales up.</li>
</ul>

Now, if your life as a programmer only revolved around high-level languages like JavaScript, Python, or even Swift, you will have a hard time realizing the time cost – not the O(n) cost – of your code. Similar to how knowing SQL helps immensely when profiling a slow ORM, knowing C helps you spot poor performance in high-level programs, even if you never get to write C code. It took me 1-2 days to realize that the culprit was ironically where I expected it the least. The performance hit was caused by the parser of the PUSH_REPLY message, which is a short comma-separated string. To be fair, the parser is quite basic, so it wasn’t the parser either: the problem was about re-creating the NSRegularExpression objects every time a new PUSH_REPLY was parsed. Of course, it doesn’t take a lot to create an NSRegularExpression but the user’s server sent dozens of PUSH_REPLY messages to the client, so the slow code was adding up very quickly. Run a 100ms vs 500ms code once and it will be okay, but run it 20 times and you easily get a 2 seconds vs 10 seconds delay. In the vast majority of servers, the PUSH_REPLY is a single message, which made the nasty issue unnoticeable to most. By then, I realized how too much OOP makes us programmers forget that even creating objects may be expensive. Imagine what AI can do without a supervisor. When performance is crucial, we should remind ourselves that the convenient, good-looking solution might be the worse choice. What “vibe coders” may not be ready for Before anything, ask yourself what your business is about. If you work at Netflix, or in the game industry, you might observe the immediate effect of an inefficient vibe-coded algorithm. In the trivial CRUD apps that make up 99.9% of the consultancy workforce, instead, you may only realize that your code has low performance after a long chain of bad choices, if ever. Performance, however, is just an example of what’s being overseen due to the increasingly fast pace at which people produce code. This leads to a few observations: If your software is “stupid”, low performance may only be hidden and therefore not seem a big deal. Engineers who underestimate the importance of performant solutions, probably never worked on challenging projects. If performance doesn’t matter to you today, it doesn’t mean it’s not important in general. Or, that it won’t be important when your business scales up. When that day comes, will you have the knowledge you need to face it?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Frontend development is easy</title><link href="https://davidederosa.com/2025/03/frontend-development-is-easy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Frontend development is easy" /><published>2025-03-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-03-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://davidederosa.com/2025/03/frontend-development-is-easy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://davidederosa.com/2025/03/frontend-development-is-easy/"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a developer, you have heard this statement at least once. While I believe that any comparison is pointless because <em>everything</em> is about programming, I’d like to add some complexities often neglected in frontend development, within the context of client/server software.</p>

<h3 id="take-it-seriously">Take it seriously</h3>

<p>Frontend is not a toy. What I find frequent in frontend developers is the <em>recklessness</em> of their choices. Backend developers tend to be more conservative because they are the ones receiving that phone call at night when a service is down, but this doesn’t mean that a frontend bug couldn’t have terrible consequences.</p>

<p>Some people claim that backend is harder than frontend because of the “more serious” problems it has to solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance</li>
  <li>Scalability</li>
  <li>Robustness</li>
  <li>Concurrency</li>
</ul>

<p>For some reason, those qualities are considered less of a priority for a well-written client, but they are equally important and sometimes <em>more</em> important. Users may spot slow, sluggish, power-hungry, buggy apps from a distance.</p>

<p>It’s also true that if you skip native backend software like web servers or databases, which are a <em>big deal</em>, most developers out there are doing simple web services. Let’s be honest: nowadays, most of the above difficulties are not dealt with at the programming level, they are delegated to long-established SaaS platforms. This is great, but only because backend developers are –in my experience– generally more aware of how things happen under the hood.</p>

<p>Sadly, frontend frameworks lead developers in the opposite direction: they make you forget the consequences of bad programming practices. They deviate from the importance of appropriate data structures and algorithms. They convince you that modern machines can endure any load. They overcomplicate code with tons of boilerplate. They waste your time moving your focus on things that nobody cares about e.g. “is that a view or a view model?”. They make you lose the foundations of programming.</p>

<p>The result is a far west full of cowboys writing inefficient, dangerous code, but this is not a problem of the frontend itself.</p>

<h3 id="never-rely-on-a-backend">Never rely on a backend</h3>

<p>Not all apps are web-oriented, and <a href="https://passepartoutvpn.app">Passepartout</a> is an example of frontend development without a backend. Or, better said, frontend development with an uncontrolled backend.</p>

<p>What does this imply? You take <em>direct responsibility</em> for your software. In a world where most apps interact with external APIs, it’s appalling how often frontend developers operate in the best-case scenario where everything works as expected.</p>

<p>I wonder how many write code that, to name a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expects malformed responses</li>
  <li>Expects no responses</li>
  <li>Handles timeouts</li>
  <li>Works fully offline</li>
  <li>Works headless (without views)</li>
  <li>Migrates persistent data without data loss</li>
</ul>

<p>This is your responsibility, not the external backend’s, and you do that by giving your frontend <em>a local backend</em> with business logic to rely on. At that point, the presence of an external backend will be of marginal importance.</p>

<h3 id="domain-before-ui">Domain before UI</h3>

<p>Business logic is another concept that, historically, the backend is more used to than the frontend. I believe that backend developers don’t see the immediate effect of their work until late, whereas
it takes a few minutes to create a meaningful UI. The instant gratification that comes from “it works!” may indefinitely delay the key decisions to take early in software development.</p>

<p>Presentation is the highest layer in software design, yet in frontend development, the importance of UI is constantly glorified. No surprise, non-tech people and the industry in general judge software from the UI, but frontend developers should prioritize the <em>domain</em> like any other non-UI developer does.</p>

<p>Any software should make sense regardless of having a UI, or a remote API, and frontend makes no exception: UI is no more than the visual representation of a domain. I believe that this simple rule also <em>dignifies</em> frontend apps for making them way more meaningful than “a couple of screens”.</p>

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>How much time do you waste interpreting users’ feedback for the lack of better options? What if you are in a real hurry to solve a frontend problem in production? Clients live in the most unpredictable environments, yet the troubleshooting of their errors is often deferred to backend monitoring.</p>

<p>Logging, proper error handling, profiling, and tracking tools are a superpower, but as long as the backend takes care of that, the frontend couldn’t care less. Drop the backend, and troubleshooting becomes a nightmare. Along the lines of “never rely on a backend”, do your homework and invest decent time in logging at least. Make it a requirement, even more than tests. It’s tedious, it’s time-consuming, but it truly pays off when SHTF.</p>

<p>Logging is a fundamental trait of software robustness, and it takes a lot of practice to describe what code does through human-readable text in a way that will help your future self later. No software is exempt from the need for logging.</p>

<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>

<p>Frontend is the face of our product, but UI is only a small part of it. Over the years, the overuse of client-side JavaScript frameworks has made frontend software less of an example of good software design. At the end of the day, though, all design principles still apply, and frontend development deserves the same care and rigor as any other layer of software development.</p>]]></content><author><name>Davide De Rosa</name></author><category term="development" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are a developer, you have heard this statement at least once.

If our skills improve at a faster pace than we maintain our software, its design will start to drift away from our standards and expectations. If we let the gap increase for too long, it will eventually be impossible to catch up, and we’ll end up hating our creations.</p>

<h3 id="version-2-was-a-mess">Version 2 was a mess</h3>

<p><a href="https://passepartoutvpn.app">Passepartout</a> used to be two separate iOS and macOS apps, with all the complications that this implies. In 2022, I used Passepartout to learn <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> –I considered Flutter initially– and make v2 a partially multiplatform app. Partially because the macOS app was a hybrid <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Catalyst/iPad</a> app, a terrible choice if I think of it today. I don’t even know why I did it, but whatever.</p>

<p>The conclusions I drew after v2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SwiftUI is very hard to get right. I had to rewrite my views multiple times due to my wrong understanding of the framework.</li>
  <li>Catalyst made the macOS app an ugly and unstable iPadOS app, let alone a complete nightmare to develop.</li>
  <li>The time I spent on the Mac system menu, in particular, was beyond ridiculous. Maybe I’ll dedicate a post to this clunky Catalyst/AppKit interaction.</li>
  <li>The app core was overengineered, untested, untestable, and confusing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit">TunnelKit</a> was already unmanageable and inextensible. Touching the wrong line could break connectivity for thousands of users.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m aware that we, developers, occasionally suffer an innate tendency to be unsatisfied with our choices, whatever they are. Redoing the same things over and over is detrimental to making progress, though. Therefore, rewriting software should <em>never</em> be your first choice. That’s why I ruminated around the idea for months, but the rewrite was inevitable 7 years after the first release.</p>

<p>Users don’t and can’t realize the amount of bugs that Passepartout v2 and TunnelKit had. The codebase, <em>my codebase</em>, was such a high barrier that it took me a year (2022 to 2023) to resolve some legitimate concerns with iCloud. Requests/bugs were sadly flowing at 30x the speed I was able to address them. The app was half abandoned.</p>

<p>It’s, however, very risky to rewrite an app that was stable, making decent money, and required very little support despite a user base in the hundreds of thousands. To end up, one year later, with the same app with more or less the same features.</p>

<p>Rewriting must be <em>really</em> worth it.</p>

<h3 id="the-costbenefit-of-rewriting-software">The cost/benefit of rewriting software</h3>

<p>Version 3 is the last time I <em>intend</em> to attack the foundations of Passepartout.</p>

<p>So many times I rewrote code in my life with the sole intent of working in a “beautiful” codebase, not realizing how quickly the enthusiasm wanes when the development routine is back to normal. Give it a few months and, no matter what, your codebase will look “ugly” again. It never ends.</p>

<p>I learned not to rely on “beauty” to bring me back to the joy of programming. After all, when I wrote those nasty lines 10 years ago, I probably thought it was the state of the art. Right?</p>

<p>Today, I try to refactor software as a regular exercise, but at a smaller scale, and with a different purpose:</p>

<p><strong>Make my changes last as long as possible.</strong></p>

<p>Below is what I did in 2024 –part-time until August– for this major update:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/passepartoutvpn/projects/1/views/4?filterQuery=">The GitHub Project for v3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/passepartoutvpn/projects/1/views/8?filterQuery=">The tasks split by goal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The project encompassed ~1000 items, of which ~350 are invisible for being in private repositories. An insane amount of work, in hindsight.</p>

<p>Today, I can confirm that it was by no means a waste of time. After one year of development, the success of this reengineering is summarized in a sentence:</p>

<p><strong>Most areas of Passepartout won’t need to be modified for years to come.</strong></p>

<p>This is the single measure you want to focus on when considering a big architectural redesign: the time you save in the long run must dramatically compensate for the effort of rewriting. With this mantra, good design will be the natural consequence. Because good design, ultimately, is meant to save development time.</p>

<p>I dare to say, automated releases are hardly (if <em>ever</em>) seen in open-source *OS apps.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.fastlane.tools/">fastlane</a>, created by <a href="https://krausefx.com/">Felix Krause</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> helped me immensely with the fast turnaround of Passepartout releases. In the era of LLMs, you have no excuses to waste time for not using these incredible tools.</p>

<p>Let me show why CI/CD is one of the most important and underestimated aspects of making indie software, or software in general.</p>

<h3 id="its-just-an-app-right">It’s just an app, right?</h3>

<p>Many people are confident that <em>The Idea</em> is the most valuable aspect of a product.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you developed an app for the App Store, at any level of complexity, you know how exhausting the whole process is. There is so much more than “writing the code”, which is nothing trivial to start with.</p>

<h3 id="the-app-store-requirements-will-beat-you">The App Store requirements will beat you</h3>

<p>Choosing the icons. Crafting the screenshots. Writing the metadata. Picking the categories. Localizations. The business model. In-app purchases. Sorting out the legal aspects. The App Review process. And so on.</p>

<p>Wait, have I mentioned the codesigning process? Development, Ad-Hoc, Distribution. Multiple platforms. Debug and Release.</p>

<p>Especially at the beginning, it’s overwhelming and discouraging. We’ve all been there.</p>

<p>The 15-30% cut that Apple takes from your revenue is almost a marginal cost compared to all this.</p>

<h3 id="the-fear-of-change">The fear of change</h3>

<p>Here’s a very subtle side-effect of the above: once your tedious setup finally works, you might <em>refrain from changing</em>.</p>

<p>Some relatable examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I change the UI, I will have to change the screenshots for X languages and Y platforms.</li>
  <li>If I alter some inner logic, I will get a rejection from Apple.</li>
  <li>If I introduce a regression, I will get bad reviews.</li>
  <li>Even if I have a hotfix in time, Apple will push my release back for silly reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>It goes without saying, this is an atrocious outcome for your product. If you work alone with no one to delegate these annoyances to, you risk falling into the ultimate recipe for failure.</p>

<p><em>Stagnation is the hidden cost of expensive deployment.</em></p>

<h3 id="you-must-learn-to-automate">You MUST learn to automate</h3>

<p>The key to keeping focus on the product is <em>automation</em>. It’s boring at first, but in the long run, it’s your best bet against the inevitable frustration of using App Store Connect.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you find yourself doing 3+ times the same task, automate it.</li>
  <li>If a task doesn’t need constant interaction, automate it.</li>
  <li>If a task is sensitive to human mistakes, automate it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Observe your routine and you will soon realize how many hours you are wasting on dumb tasks, time you could have spent on useful features for your customers.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-integration-is-underused">Continuous integration is underused!</h3>

<p>After 15 years working with Apple devices, I can still confirm this trend: the vast majority of iOS developers don’t know jack about <em>continuous integration</em>. Which is crazy because fastlane has been around since 2014. GitHub Actions has a shorter history, but there have always been alternatives: Travis-CI, GitLab, Circle-CI, and whatnot.</p>

<p>In the next posts, I’ll show you how I used fastlane and GitHub Actions to automate the release of Passepartout for iOS, macOS, and tvOS at once.</p>

<p>However, a couple of regressions were still haunting me.</p>

<p>Here I want to describe the absurd journey into one of them, that started with a report <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/issues/1204">from GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/passepartout/comments/1j0lbqa/not_open_in_sonoma_any_idea/">one from Reddit</a>. Both users were reporting that the Mac app was crashing on launch.</p>

<p>The reports led me to think that the regression was caused by the macOS version, or the CPU architecture, as both users were using an Intel-based machine.</p>

<h3 id="the-xcode-organizer">The Xcode Organizer</h3>

<p>I had several (unhelpful) crashes in the Xcode Organizer confirming the issue:</p>

<div class="h-scrolling">
    <img alt="Xcode Organizer" src="/s/posts/2025-03-03-01.png" />
</div>

<p>Looking further into some crashes, I could spot a few SIGILL (Illegal Hardware Instruction) that reinforced the idea of a platform-related issue. Add to that, one of the threads had intense Core Data + CloudKit activity ongoing. It must be Core Data, I thought, given that Passepartout performs its sync precisely when the app launches.</p>

<p><em>Doubt #1: how can the app launch at all if the arch is unsupported?</em></p>

<p><em>Doubt #2: is the Core Data stack trace relevant? Is it the thread that is actually crashing?</em></p>

<h3 id="never-read-crash-reports-only-once">Never read crash reports only once</h3>

<p>Passepartout is a privacy-oriented app. There is no external framework e.g. Firebase to help with crash resolution, so Xcode is the only technical resource at disposal. Plus the patient support from the affected users.</p>

<p>Eventually, Core Data was a distraction. Every report was crashing on “Thread 0”, i.e. the main thread. There were also crashes from macOS 15 and ARM64. Fewer, but non-zero.</p>

<p>This stack trace shed some light in that the injected AppDelegate could be the culprit. But where? And why?</p>

<h3 id="reproducing-the-crash-pt-1">Reproducing the crash (pt. 1)</h3>

<p>Assuming that the AppDelegate was doing something wrong, there was even a much bigger issue: I could not reproduce the crash on my machine. I realized, though, that a friend of mine had an Intel MacBook with macOS 14, so I asked for his help.</p>

<p>He gave me access via AnyDesk to push ad hoc builds to the machine. The latest app version crashed consistently. Off to a good start. At that point, I spent a few hours trying to exclude potentially offending parts from the launch code, sadly to no avail. Consider that any change in the code implied archiving and sending a build via AnyDesk to test it. It was exhausting, and the afternoon led nowhere.</p>

<h3 id="reproducing-the-crash-pt-2">Reproducing the crash (pt. 2)</h3>

<p>I decide to give a shot to virtualization. Most crashes came from macOS 14, and not necessarily from Intel machines, so this could work. These were the steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/">UTM</a> to run a VM on Mac. <em>Highly recommended!</em></li>
  <li>Download a restore image for Sonoma (~14GB)</li>
  <li>Regenerate the provisioning profile with the VM UDID</li>
  <li>Send the development build via a shared folder to the VM</li>
</ul>

<p>The app crashes. Hooray!</p>

<h3 id="git-to-the-rescue">Git to the rescue</h3>

<p>Time to locate where the regression was introduced. I rebuilt the app for each commit that sounded relevant, and after 10-20 builds, I found out that the crash was introduced in <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/pull/1200">this pull request</a> about the light/dark mode picker in the app preferences. WTF?!</p>

<p>It turns out, the widely used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapp"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> singleton</a> is an <strong>implicitly unwrapped optional</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@MainActor
var NSApp: NSApplication!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it was therefore used unsafely in this bit of the PR:</p>

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed-v2.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpassepartoutvpn%2Fpassepartout%2Fblob%2Fv3.1.1%2FPackages%2FApp%2FSources%2FUILibrary%2FBusiness%2FAppearanceManager.swift%23L66-73&amp;style=default&amp;type=code&amp;showBorder=on&amp;showLineNumbers=on&amp;showFileMeta=on&amp;showFullPath=on&amp;showCopy=on"></script>

<h3 id="a-race-condition-about-nsapp">A race condition about NSApp</h3>

<p>It’s finally revealed that, very early in a Mac app lifecycle, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> may be nil. This was more often the case on macOS 14 than 15, but still a hideous race condition.</p>

<p>Here goes the simplified stack call:</p>

<ul>
  <li>main</li>
  <li>AppDelegate.init</li>
  <li>AppearanceManager.init</li>
  <li>AppearanceManager.systemAppearance.didSet</li>
  <li>AppearanceManager.apply()</li>
  <li>NSApp.appearance = …</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last call, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> may be nil and implicitly unwrapped, leading to the crash.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h3>

<p>This was one of those bugs that make you question everything—platform differences, architecture quirks, even Core Data conspiracies—before revealing a simple yet insidious root cause: a race condition with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code>.</p>

<p>The takeaway? Even well-documented singletons aren’t always safe to assume as non-nil. And when debugging obscure crashes, patience and a systematic approach (plus a good VM setup) can make all the difference.</p>

<p>Passepartout v3.1.5 <a href="https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout/pull/1224">will handle this case properly</a>, ensuring that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NSApp</code> is accessed only when it’s actually available. Hopefully, that’s one less obscure crash lurking in the shadows.</p>

<p>To Apple and Swift: isn’t it about time to discourage/deprecate the use of implicitly unwrapped optionals?</p>]]></content><author><name>Davide De Rosa</name></author><category term="development" /><category term="swift" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One month after its first, painful release, Passepartout v3 is close to being stable.
